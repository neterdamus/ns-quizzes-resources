## India Eliminates Extreme Poverty

**Source:** Bhalla, S. S., & Bhasin, K. (2024, March 1). India eliminates extreme poverty. Brookings. https://www.brookings.edu/articles/india-eliminates-extreme-poverty/

**Main Theme:** India has successfully eliminated extreme poverty, according to new official data. This achievement is attributed to strong economic growth, targeted social programs, and a significant decline in both urban and rural inequality.

**Key Findings:**

- **Poverty Reduction:** The Headcount Poverty Ratio (HCR) for the PPP$1.9 poverty line has plummeted from 12.2% in 2011-12 to 2% in 2022-23.
- **Growth and Inequality:** Real per capita consumption grew at 2.9% annually since 2011-12, with rural areas experiencing higher growth (3.1%) than urban areas (2.6%). This growth was coupled with an unprecedented decline in inequality across both urban and rural areas.
- **Impact of Social Programs:** Targeted social programs focusing on rural development, including improved sanitation, access to electricity and clean water, and the Aspirational District Program, have contributed to poverty reduction.
- **Need for a Higher Poverty Line:** Given the near elimination of extreme poverty, the authors argue that India should transition to a higher poverty line (PPP$3.2) to better reflect the country's current economic reality.
- **Redefining Social Protection:** This transition presents an opportunity to optimize existing social protection programs to ensure better identification of beneficiaries and more effective support for those still living in poverty.

**Supporting Quotes:**

- "Official data now confirms that India has eliminated extreme poverty, as commonly defined in international comparisons."
- "The transition to a higher poverty line provides an opportunity to redefine existing social protection programs particularly with the objective of better identification of intended beneficiaries and providing greater support to the genuine poor."
- "The relatively higher consumption growth in rural areas should not come as a surprise given the strong policy thrust on redistribution through a wide variety of publicly funded programs."

**Implications:**

- **Global Poverty Reduction:** India's success significantly impacts global poverty headcount rates and serves as a model for other developing nations.
- **Focus on Inclusive Growth:** The findings highlight the importance of inclusive growth strategies that prioritize poverty reduction alongside economic development.
- **Policy Adaptation:** India needs to adapt its policies and programs to address the remaining poverty using a higher poverty line as a benchmark.

**Next Steps:**

- Further analysis is needed to understand the factors driving the significant decline in inequality.
- Examining the effectiveness and impact of specific social programs will inform future policy decisions.
- Public discourse and stakeholder engagement are crucial to establishing a new poverty line and reforming social protection programs.
