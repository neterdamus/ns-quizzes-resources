## India Stack - A Digital Blueprint for the Future

**Source:** Excerpts from "The Internet Country" by Aaryaman.Vir and Rahul Sanghi (tigerfeathers.substack.com)

**Main Themes:**

- **India Stack:** A revolutionary program consisting of interconnected digital building blocks (Aadhaar, UPI, and DEPA) that are transforming India's economy by addressing the fundamental economic primitives of identity, payments, and data.
- **Leapfrogging Development:** India Stack's innovative approach allows India to bypass traditional stages of economic development and achieve rapid progress in financial inclusion and digital transformation.
- **Public Digital Infrastructure:** The program highlights the crucial role of the state in building robust digital infrastructure that empowers both citizens and businesses.
- **Global Implications:** India Stack's success offers a compelling model for other countries seeking to navigate the digital age and achieve inclusive economic growth.

**Key Ideas and Facts:**

**1. Aadhaar: The Foundation**

- Provides a unique digital identity to every Indian citizen, enabling them to access various services and participate in the formal economy.
- Implemented e-authentication (e-auth) and e-KYC, significantly streamlining identity verification processes for various services, including financial services and telecom.
- **Impact:**Increased financial inclusion by dramatically reducing customer onboarding costs for banks, leading to a surge in bank account ownership.
- **"The World Bank estimates that Aadhaar e-KYC brought down the customer onboarding cost for an Indian bank from $23 to just $0.15."**
- Facilitated rapid customer acquisition for telecom companies like Reliance Jio.
- Enabled the creation of other services like e-Sign and Digilocker, eliminating the need for physical documents.

**2. UPI: Powering Seamless Payments**

- A mobile-based payments platform that operates on a central switch managed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), connecting all licensed banks.
- Features a three-tiered structure:
- Base layer: NPCI's public rails handle payment message routing.
- Second layer: Regulated banks hold user funds and update balances.
- Third layer: Fintech apps and payment providers access the system through APIs.
- Introduces Virtual Payment Address (VPA) allowing users to send and receive payments using easily memorable IDs.
- Enables e-mandates for recurring transactions and plans to introduce e-liens for managing future cash flows, paving the way for programmable payments.
- **Impact:**Created a homegrown payments infrastructure capable of handling massive scale.
- Fostered a thriving fintech ecosystem with simplified integration for payment apps.
- **"India in the 2020s will be like China in the 2010s. Few people really understand the full implications." - balajis.com**

**3. DEPA: Unleashing the Power of Data**

- A policy framework designed to empower individuals and businesses to control and leverage their data.
- Based on principles enshrined in the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP), which grants individuals rights to data confirmation, correction, erasure, and portability.
- Introduces Account Aggregators (AAs) as regulated intermediaries that facilitate the secure and consented transfer of user data between entities.
- **Impact:**Empowers users to manage and share their data selectively, ensuring data privacy and security.
- Simplifies data sharing for various purposes, such as loan applications, eliminating the need for cumbersome manual processes.
- Opens up possibilities for innovative data-driven products and services across various industries.

**4. OCEN: Revolutionizing Credit Underwriting**

- Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) leverages the DEPA framework to enable alternative data-based credit underwriting.
- Marketplaces and aggregators can use the AA consent flow to allow sellers and service providers to share performance data with lenders.
- **Impact:**Expands access to credit for SMEs and individuals who lack traditional collateral by leveraging their cash flow data.
- Streamlines and digitizes the entire loan origination and disbursement process.

**Drawbacks and Considerations:**

- **Privacy concerns:** Critics raise concerns about potential data breaches and misuse of personal information within Aadhaar.
- **Exclusion:** While Aadhaar has significantly boosted financial inclusion, certain segments of the population still face challenges in enrollment and accessing benefits.
- **Market dominance:** The UPI market is dominated by large, foreign-owned tech companies, potentially limiting the growth of local players.

**Closing Thoughts:**

- India Stack demonstrates a successful model of public-private partnership in driving digital transformation and economic growth.
- Its focus on building robust and inclusive digital infrastructure offers valuable lessons for other countries.
- As India continues to refine and expand its digital ecosystem, it has the potential to become a global leader in the digital economy.
- **"India’s attempt to solve for the economic primitives of identity, payments, data, and credit – through its digital infrastructure project known as India Stack – provide a progressive and accessible template for all countries wishing to upgrade their economies for the Internet Age."**
