## Timeline of Aadhaar System

**2009:**

- The Aadhaar system is conceptualized to address the lack of individual identity documents for roughly 400 million Indians. At this time, only 17% of the population has bank accounts, and government subsidies suffer from significant leakage.
- The Indian government earmarks Rs 100 cr (US$ 13 million) and creates a chairperson position with cabinet minister rank to initiate the Unique Identification Project.
- The Unique Identification Database Authority of India (UIDAI) is formed to oversee the project, bringing in volunteers with expertise in design thinking, architecture, operations, and data privacy.

**2010 - 2014:**

- Aadhaar enrollment begins, aiming to reach a critical mass of users to ensure project continuation across government changes.
- The project successfully reaches 600 million IDs in four years.

**2016:**

- Digi Dhan Mela, an initiative by the Government of India to promote digital payment methods, sees individuals linking their Aadhaar numbers with their bank accounts.

**2019:**

- A pulse survey across 28 Indian states and union territories finds 90% of people trust their data in the Aadhaar system, and 95% of those without an Aadhaar want to obtain one.

**2020:**

- The U.K. scraps its identification card scheme due to high costs, while India successfully delivers identification cards at a budget of US$ 1 per person.
- The Supreme Court upholds the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, affirming that the Aadhaar Act does not violate a person's right to privacy.

**2021:**

- India dispenses over 950 million vaccine doses through its "CoWIN" digital platform, ensuring equitable access to vaccination for all citizens.
- A stimulus package targeting vulnerable groups is rolled out, with US$ 450 billion in aid directly deposited into the bank accounts of over 421 million people by September 2020.
- The first phase of the COVID-19 lockdown sees 11 million Micro ATM transactions using Aadhaar authentication each day.

**Present:**

- Aadhaar has documented the identities of over 94.2% of India's population.
- The system has facilitated over 57 billion authentication transactions, returning a biometric match in 93.5% of cases.
- Aadhaar continues to evolve, with plans to reach more citizens, simplify enrollment and updates, and integrate with other societal platforms.
