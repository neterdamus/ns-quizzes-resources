2. **What are the key components of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)?**
3. **Describe the primary data sources used in the study and their respective levels of analysis.**
4. **How did the researchers graphically analyze the association between toilet coverage and infant mortality?**
5. **Explain the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model used in the study.**
6. **What were the three types of tests conducted to support the primary model's assumptions?**
7. **What did the study find regarding the relationship between SBM coverage and child growth?**
8. **Explain the interaction effects explored between SBM coverage and (a) BCG vaccination coverage, and (b) piped water access.**
9. **Discuss the robustness checks performed using (a) state-level data and (b) individual-level data.**
10. **What are the main limitations acknowledged in the study?**

### Answer Key

1. The “Asian Enigma” refers to the disproportionately high rates of child stunting in India compared to other LMICs, despite economic progress. Open defecation is considered a major contributing factor, leading to repeated infections and nutrient malabsorption.
2. SBM's key components include: (a) subsidized toilet construction, (b) IEC campaigns promoting sanitation and hygiene, (c) capacity building and training programs, (d) waste management systems, and (e) technology-enabled monitoring and citizen engagement.
3. The study used the Vital Registration System (VRS) for state-level infant mortality estimates, and the District Level Household Surveys (DLHS) and National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) for district-level estimates of infant and under-five mortality. SBM coverage data came from the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
4. Researchers mapped IMR and toilet coverage across districts over time, generated scatterplots to visualize the cross-sectional and first-difference associations between IMR and toilet coverage, and mapped cumulative SBM coverage.
5. The TWFE model controlled for unobserved district-specific and birth cohort-specific factors by including district and birth year fixed effects. It estimated the "net association" between changes in SBM-related toilet construction and changes in IMR or U5MR.
6. The tests included: (a) a randomization inference test to determine the probability of results occurring by chance, (b) a fake treatment test using pre-SBM data to assess pre-existing trends, and (c) applying the primary model to placebo outcomes unrelated to SBM.
7. The study found evidence of a threshold effect, with significant improvements in child height-for-age z-scores observed at SBM coverage levels exceeding 30%.
8. (a) The interaction between SBM and BCG vaccination coverage revealed that SBM benefits were more pronounced in districts with low BCG coverage, suggesting existing health infrastructure influences sanitation outcomes. (b) Interaction tests with piped water access showed that SBM benefits were less dependent on piped water, possibly due to SBM's promotion of twin-pit toilets that don't require continuous water supply.
9. (a) State-level analysis using VRS data revealed accelerated IMR reductions in the post-SBM period compared to the pre-SBM trend. (b) Individual-level analysis examining the probability of infant and under-five deaths showed a consistent decline with increased SBM coverage, supporting the district-level findings.
10. Limitations include potential endogeneity in SBM coverage, unmeasured confounders, the ecological level of analysis, and the lack of cause-specific mortality data.

### Essay Questions

1. **Critically evaluate the study's methodology, highlighting its strengths and limitations in establishing a link between SBM and child mortality.**
2. **Discuss the potential mechanisms through which increased toilet access under SBM could contribute to reductions in infant and child mortality.**
3. **The study finds evidence of a threshold effect at 30% SBM coverage. Analyze the implications of this finding for policy and program implementation.**
4. **Considering the potential limitations and ethical concerns associated with SBM implementation, propose strategies for enhancing program effectiveness and ensuring equitable access to sanitation facilities.**
5. **Drawing upon the study's findings and considering the broader context of child health in India, discuss the role of sanitation interventions within a comprehensive approach to improving child survival.**

### Glossary of Key Terms

**Asian Enigma:** The phenomenon of disproportionately high child stunting rates in India compared to other LMICs despite economic progress.

**Open Defecation:** The practice of defecating in open areas rather than designated sanitation facilities.

**Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM):** A national sanitation campaign in India launched in 2014 aiming to eliminate open defecation by providing access to toilets and promoting hygiene practices.

**Infant Mortality Rate (IMR):** The number of infant deaths (under one year of age) per 1,000 live births.

**Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR):** The number of deaths of children under five years of age per 1,000 live births.

**Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) Model:** A statistical model that controls for unobserved factors that vary across both districts and time, allowing for estimation of the net effect of an intervention.

**Placebo Outcome:** A variable that is not expected to be affected by the intervention, used to test the validity of the study design and rule out spurious associations.

**Threshold Effect:** A point at which a change in exposure levels leads to a significant change in the outcome, indicating a non-linear relationship.

**Endogeneity:** A situation where the independent variable (exposure) is correlated with the error term in a statistical model, potentially leading to biased estimates.

**Ecological Fallacy:** The error of making inferences about individuals based on aggregate data for a group.
