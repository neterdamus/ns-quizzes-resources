## Understanding Poverty Reduction in India

**Short-Answer Quiz**

1. **What are the two methods India uses to estimate consumption expenditures, and what is the key difference between them?**
2. **What were the major findings from India's 2022-23 consumption expenditure data regarding growth, inequality, and poverty?**
3. **What specific poverty lines are discussed in the article, and how has the poverty headcount ratio (HCR) changed for each?**
4. **Why do the authors argue that India should transition to a higher poverty line?**
5. **What are some examples of publicly funded programs that have contributed to higher consumption growth in rural areas?**
6. **How has access to piped water changed in rural India, and how might this impact poverty levels?**
7. **What is the Aspirational District Program, and what was its purpose?**
8. **What is the significance of India's poverty reduction for global poverty headcount rates?**
9. **According to the article, what opportunity does the transition to a higher poverty line present for social protection programs in India?**
10. **What is the World Bank's estimated poverty rate in India, and how does it compare to the findings of the official Indian data?**

**Answer Key**

1. The two methods are the Uniform Recall Period (URP) and the Modified Mixed Recall Period (MMRP). URP asks about expenditures over a uniform 30-day period, while MMRP uses different recall periods for different types of goods (7 days for perishables, 365 days for durables, and 30 days for others).
2. The data showed real per capita consumption growth of 2.9% per year since 2011-12, with rural growth outpacing urban growth. Both urban and rural inequality declined significantly. The poverty headcount ratio (HCR) for the PPP$1.9 poverty line fell to 2%, effectively eliminating extreme poverty.
3. The article discusses the PPP$1.9 (international extreme poverty line) and the PPP$3.2 (World Bank recommended line for lower-middle-income countries). The HCR for the $1.9 line fell from 12.2% to 2%, while for the $3.2 line it declined from 53.6% to 20.8%.
4. The authors argue that a higher poverty line is necessary because extreme poverty has been virtually eliminated, and further progress requires focusing on those still struggling at higher income levels.
5. Examples include programs for toilet construction, universal access to electricity, modern cooking fuel, and piped water. These programs aim to improve living standards and provide basic necessities, particularly in rural areas.
6. Access to piped water in rural India has increased dramatically from 16.8% in 2019 to 74.7% currently. This improved access to safe water can reduce illness and healthcare costs, potentially boosting family income and reducing poverty.
7. The Aspirational District Program targeted 112 districts with the lowest development indicators and focused government efforts on improving their performance in various areas. This targeted approach aimed to uplift the most disadvantaged regions and contribute to overall poverty reduction.
8. India's success in reducing poverty has significant implications for global poverty headcount rates. As a populous country, India's progress contributes substantially to global efforts in poverty reduction.
9. The transition to a higher poverty line offers an opportunity to reassess and redesign social protection programs to better identify and support those who are genuinely poor, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively.
10. The World Bank estimated poverty rates in India at 10% for the $1.9 line and 45% for the $3.2 line in 2020. The official Indian data show significantly lower poverty rates, highlighting the discrepancies between these estimates.

**Essay Questions**

1. Analyze the factors contributing to India's success in reducing extreme poverty. How have specific government policies and programs played a role?
2. Discuss the limitations of relying solely on income-based poverty lines. What other dimensions of poverty should be considered when assessing the well-being of a population?
3. Evaluate the potential challenges and opportunities associated with transitioning to a higher poverty line in India. How might this impact social protection programs and resource allocation?
4. Compare and contrast the methodologies used by the World Bank and the Indian government to estimate poverty rates. What might explain the discrepancies in their findings?
5. Explore the implications of India's poverty reduction for global development goals. How does India's progress contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 1 (No Poverty)?
