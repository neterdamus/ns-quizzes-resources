### Short Answer Key

1. **Aadhaar is India's biometric-based digital identity system designed to provide a unique identity to every resident. It was implemented to address the issue of millions lacking proper identification and facing challenges accessing essential services.**
2. **Two key design principles are "Absolute Minimalism" and "Build Trust by Design." Minimalism ensures the system focuses solely on providing and verifying unique identities, collecting only essential data. Trust is fostered by ensuring data accuracy and security, empowering individuals to confidently use the system.**
3. **Aadhaar empowers individuals by providing them with their first formal proof of identity, enabling access to government services, financial inclusion, and fundamental rights like voting. This, in turn, fosters a sense of "belonging" within society.**
4. **Aadhaar has contributed to economic growth by reducing leakages in subsidy programs, enabling direct benefit transfers, and facilitating access to financial services for millions. McKinsey estimates it has unlocked 3-13% of India's GDP.**
5. **"Introducers" are trusted individuals within communities, such as village leaders, who can vouch for the identity of those lacking documentation. This ensures inclusivity by enabling enrollment even without traditional proof of identity.**
6. **Aadhaar safeguards privacy by using random 12-digit numbers with no embedded personal information. Authentication only confirms identity with a yes/no response, without revealing additional data. The system is designed to minimize data collection and restrict access.**
7. **IndiaStack is a set of APIs built upon Aadhaar, allowing governments, businesses, and developers to utilize the digital infrastructure for streamlined, paperless service delivery.**
8. **The Aadhaar Micro ATM allows individuals to perform basic financial transactions using their Aadhaar number and fingerprint. During the COVID-19 lockdown, it enabled millions to access cash and essential services without visiting banks, showcasing its importance during crises.**
9. **Aadhaar faced challenges including privacy concerns and legal battles, navigating inter-ministerial bureaucracy, managing costs, fostering public-private partnerships, achieving rapid adoption within a limited timeframe, and ensuring widespread user acceptance.**
10. **The future vision for Aadhaar involves expanding its role as a foundational building block within a decentralized societal infrastructure. By integrating with other platforms, it aims to enhance access to education, healthcare, and livelihood opportunities, further empowering citizens.**
