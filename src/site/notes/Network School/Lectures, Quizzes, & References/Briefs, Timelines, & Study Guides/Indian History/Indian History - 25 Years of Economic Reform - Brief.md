## Twenty-Five Years of Indian Economic Reform

**Source:** Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar, "Twenty-Five Years of Indian Economic Reform," Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 803, October 26, 2016.

**Main Themes:**

- **Economic Transformation:** India transitioned from a socialist, slow-growing economy to the fastest-growing major economy in the world. This was fueled by economic liberalization policies starting in 1991, moving India from a low-income to a middle-income country.
- **Private Sector Success vs. Government Failure:** Liberalization led to remarkable private sector success, exemplified by booming IT, pharmaceutical, and automotive industries. However, government service delivery remains poor, plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and a lack of accountability.
- **Neo-illiberalism:** While some old controls were abolished, new regulations emerged in areas like environment, land, and tribal rights, hindering economic freedom and ease of doing business.
- **Institutional Weakness:** Inefficient judiciary, corrupt police, criminalized politics, and a lack of accountability in the civil service are major roadblocks to achieving high-income status.

**Key Successes:**

- **Global Recognition:** India is now recognized as a potential superpower and a key player on the global stage.
- "Once an object of pity, India has become an object of envy among developing countries; it is often called a potential superpower and is backed by the United States for a seat on the UN Security Council."
- **Economic Growth:** India boasts the third-largest GDP in purchasing power parity terms and has experienced significant growth in per capita income.
- "India now has the third-largest GDP ($7.98 trillion) in the world in purchasing power parity terms after China and the United States."
- **Foreign Investment and Remittances:** The country attracts significant foreign investment and enjoys robust remittances from overseas Indians, making foreign aid irrelevant.
- **Agricultural Transformation:** India achieved food security through the Green Revolution and became a leading exporter of rice, wheat, and maize.
- **Technological Advancement:** The IT sector has flourished, with India becoming a global hub for software development and frugal engineering.
- **Rise of New Entrepreneurs:** Liberalization led to the emergence of numerous new businesses and entrepreneurs across various sectors, challenging old crony capitalist structures.

**Key Failures:**

- **Neoliberalism or Neo-illiberalism?**"Although many old controls and licenses have indeed been abolished over the past 25 years, many new controls and bureaucratic hurdles have appeared...so what leftist critics call an era of neoliberalism could more accurately be called neo-illiberalism."
- **Poor Governance:Judiciary:** Massive case backlog and corruption. "India holds the world record for legal case backlogs (31.5 million), which will take 320 years to clear."
- **Police:** Inefficient, corrupt, and understaffed. "The police are notoriously inefficient and corrupt. In many states, they will not even register complaints without a bribe."
- **Politics:** Criminalization of politics with many elected officials facing serious criminal charges.
- **Corruption:** While corruption decreased in liberalized sectors, it increased in areas like natural resources and infrastructure projects.
- **Lousy Government Services:Education:** Poor quality of public education leading to high dropout rates and a shortage of skilled labor. "Surveys have shown that half of government schools have no teaching activity at all: teacher absenteeism is chronic, which induces high pupil absenteeism."
- **Health:** Low public health spending results in poor health indicators. "India has some of the worst nutritional indicators in the world."
- **Infrastructure Bottlenecks:** Despite efforts, infrastructure remains inadequate, hindering economic growth. Public-private partnerships have been plagued by issues and financial losses.
- **Skill Shortage:** Lack of quality education and vocational training creates a shortage of skilled labor, undermining the potential demographic dividend. "India is now witnessing a demand from relatively well-off castes...for reclassification as “backward castes,” so that they qualify for a quota in government jobs and top educational institutions."

**Conclusion:**

India's economic transformation is a remarkable success story. However, to achieve high-income status, it must address critical failures in governance, institutional quality, and public service delivery. Deep reforms are needed to ensure accountability, reduce corruption, improve infrastructure, and develop a skilled workforce. Failure to do so will risk jeopardizing future growth and prosperity.
