**Answer Key**

1. The Salt March was a pivotal moment in the Indian Independence Movement, as it effectively challenged the British salt tax, which had heavily impacted the poorest Indians. Gandhi's act of civil disobedience sparked nationwide protests and drew international attention to the injustices of British rule.
2. Gandhi's time in South Africa exposed him to racial discrimination and oppression, which deeply impacted his worldview. He developed the concept of satyagraha, a nonviolent resistance strategy, while fighting for the rights of Indians in South Africa. These experiences shaped his leadership and methods upon his return to India.
3. The Indian National Congress played a central role in the fight for independence, evolving from an elite group to a mass movement under Gandhi's leadership. The Congress organized protests, boycotts, and civil disobedience campaigns, ultimately putting immense pressure on the British government.
4. Satyagraha, meaning "holding onto truth," was Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance. It emphasized truth, nonviolence, and self-suffering to expose injustice and bring about change. In the Indian Independence Movement, satyagraha manifested through boycotts, marches, and peaceful protests.
5. The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League diverged on the question of representation and the future of a post-independence India. The Muslim League, under Jinnah's leadership, demanded a separate Muslim state, while the Congress advocated for a united, secular India. These disagreements ultimately led to the partition.
6. World War II significantly impacted the Indian Independence Movement. With Britain preoccupied with the war effort, Indians saw an opportunity to push for independence. The Quit India Movement, launched during the war, intensified the struggle and demonstrated the widespread desire for self-rule.
7. The partition of India and Pakistan was a "bittersweet victory" because it granted independence to the Indian subcontinent but also resulted in widespread violence and displacement. Millions were forced to migrate across newly drawn borders, leading to communal riots and immense suffering.
8. Key factors that led to the success of the Indian Independence Movement include: Gandhi's leadership and philosophy of satyagraha, the persistent efforts of the Indian National Congress, the increasing pressure from within India and internationally, and the weakened state of Britain after World War II.
9. Gandhi's "constructive program" aimed at building a self-reliant and just India from the ground up. It focused on village revitalization, promoting hand-spinning and weaving (khadi), and uplifting the Harijans (untouchables) through social reform and economic empowerment.
10. Gandhi's assassination had a profound impact on newly independent India. It cast a shadow over the celebrations and highlighted the deep communal tensions that still existed. His death, however, solidified his legacy as a symbol of peace and nonviolence, inspiring future generations of activists worldwide.
