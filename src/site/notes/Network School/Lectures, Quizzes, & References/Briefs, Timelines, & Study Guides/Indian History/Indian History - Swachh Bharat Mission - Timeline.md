## Timeline of the Swachh Bharat Mission and its Impact on Infant Mortality in India

**Pre-SBM Period:**

- **Early 1900s:** Improved sanitation in the United States and other western countries leads to dramatic declines in infant mortality.
- **2002-2004:** District Level Household Survey (DLHS) 2 conducted. Toilet coverage remains low across India.
- **2007-2008:** DLHS 3 conducted. Toilet coverage shows minimal improvement, some districts even experience a decline in access.

**SBM Implementation and Initial Years:**

- **October 2nd, 2014:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), a nationwide sanitation program.
- **2014-2020:** SBM averages an annual budget of approximately 1.25 billion USD. Key components include:
- Subsidized toilet construction
- Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) campaigns
- Capacity building and training programs
- Waste management systems
- Citizen engagement and monitoring through mobile and web applications
- **2015-2016:** National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 conducted. Toilet coverage has substantially improved nationwide.
- **2016:** Pradhan Mantri Ujjwalak Yojana (PMJY), a clean cooking fuel program, is introduced.

**SBM Impact and Evaluation:**

- **2015-2020:** SBM leads to a dramatic increase in toilet access across India. Over 100 million household toilets are constructed, and over 600,000 villages are declared open defecation free.
- **2019-2021:** NFHS 5 conducted. The majority of districts have toilet coverage exceeding 60%.
- **2020:** India declares itself open defecation free.
- **2024:** A study published in _Scientific Reports_ finds a strong association between increased toilet access under SBM and reductions in infant and child mortality. The study estimates that the provision of toilets at scale may have contributed to averting approximately 60,000-70,000 infant deaths annually.
