## Timeline of Events in India's Socialist Economic Policy

**1920s-1930s:**

- **1920s-1930s:** Leading Indian nationalist figures like Gandhi, Nehru, and Tagore engage with socialist ideas, rejecting violent means but supporting socialist objectives. Nehru is particularly influenced by Fabian socialist thought.
- **1927:** Nehru visits the Soviet Union, expressing admiration for its achievements but later tempering his views in light of the purge trials.

**1947-1950s:**

- **1947:** India gains independence. The Congress Party, influenced by socialist ideas, adopts a mixed economy model for the newly independent nation.
- **1949-1950:** India enters the planning period with the First Five-Year Plan, focusing on broad fiscal policy objectives and social-overhead projects.

**1950s-1960s:**

- **1956-1961:** The Second Five-Year Plan emphasizes heavy industry and triggers a foreign exchange crisis, leading to tighter controls on foreign exchange and increased industrial licensing.
- **1956-1960s:** India utilizes substantial foreign aid, aiming to achieve self-sustained growth within 25 years.
- **Early 1960s:** The Industrial Regulation Act of 1961 further elevates the approach of industrial licensing and targeting to a central principle.
- **Mid-1960s:** Doubts emerge regarding the efficacy of India's socialist policies as growth rates disappoint and income distribution remains skewed.
- **Late 1960s:** The witticism about India's "socialist pattern" being mere "socialist patter" gains traction, reflecting growing disillusionment with the actual impact of socialist policies.

**Late 1960s-1970s:**

- **1969:** The nationalization of banks takes place, seen by many as a politically motivated move rather than a genuine commitment to socialist principles.
- **Early 1970s:** The focus on poverty elimination through public consumption (health and education) intensifies.
- **1973:** Nationalization of the wholesale wheat trade proves disastrous, forcing the government to backtrack.
- **Mid-1970s:** Concerns about the "rentier" nature of India's economy grow, with socialist policies seen as creating sheltered markets and fostering inefficiency. Land reforms are deemed largely ineffective.
- **Mid-1970s:** The Green Revolution, while increasing agricultural output, primarily benefits larger farmers, with limited impact on poverty alleviation.

## Cast of Characters

**Mahatma Gandhi:**

- Prominent leader of the Indian independence movement, advocated for non-violent resistance and a classless society. Rejected violent means of achieving socialism.

**Jawaharlal Nehru:**

- India's first Prime Minister (1947-1964), heavily influenced by Fabian socialism. Instrumental in shaping India's mixed economy model and five-year plans.

**Rabindranath Tagore:**

- Bengali polymath and Nobel laureate, supported socialist objectives while rejecting violence.

**K.N. Raj:**

- Influential Indian economist, critical of the limited reach of public distribution systems and the ineffectiveness of land reforms in addressing poverty.

**Raj Krishna:**

- Indian economist who coined the term "first-round socialism" to describe the tendency of ostensibly socialist measures in India to be subverted or fail in their execution.

**Indira Gandhi:**

- Prime Minister of India (1966-1977, 1980-1984), pursued a more populist and interventionist approach, including the nationalization of banks.

**Western Commentators:**

- Initially viewed India's mixed economy model favorably, contrasting it with communist China. Later became more critical, comparing it unfavorably to other developing economies like Pakistan and South Korea.

**Soviet-Bloc:**

**Landless Labourers:**

- Despite socialist goals of equity, largely failed to benefit from economic policies. Land reforms proved ineffective, and the Green Revolution largely benefited larger farmers.

**Large Industrial Houses:**

- Despite policies aimed at preventing concentration of wealth, continued to amass economic power. Benefited from the sheltered markets created by industrial licensing.

**Government Officials:**

- Part of a "rentier" class benefiting from socialist policies. Received preferential access to scarce goods due to price controls and quotas.

**Bureaucrats:**

- Played a significant role in the implementation of socialist policies, but the bureaucratic structure of public sector enterprises often hampered efficiency.

**English Economists:**

- Particularly Fabian socialists and those at Cambridge, shaped the thinking of many Indian intellectuals and policymakers, emphasizing the limitations of laissez-faire economics.
