### Short Answer Quiz Answer Key

1. Aadhaar provides every Indian with a foundational digital identity, enabling them to participate in the formal economy and access various services.
2. **e-auth** simply verifies the identity of an individual using their Aadhaar number and demographic data, returning a yes/no response. **e-KYC**, however, returns the user's demographic data and photograph upon successful authentication, facilitating KYC processes.
3. Aadhaar e-KYC significantly reduced customer onboarding costs for banks, making it economically viable to open accounts for previously excluded populations. This contributed to a dramatic increase in financial inclusion, with the number of adults with bank accounts rising from under 20% in 2011 to nearly 80% in 2018.
4. The three tiers of UPI are: (1) The base layer with NPCI providing public rails for routing payment messages. (2) The middle layer consisting of regulated banks holding user funds and updating balances. (3) The top layer comprising fintech apps that access the system through APIs.
5. A VPA or UPI ID is a unique identifier linked to a user's bank account on UPI. It allows for seamless payments between users of different UPI apps without needing to share sensitive bank details.
6. DEPA, the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture, is a framework that defines how individuals and businesses can control and utilize their data. It draws upon the principles of data rights outlined in the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP), which aims to grant individuals greater control over their personal data.
7. Account Aggregators (AAs) act as consent managers within DEPA. They facilitate the secure and consented transfer of user data between entities, ensuring user control and data privacy.
8. DEPA enhances data security by eliminating the need for users to share sensitive information like banking passwords or upload PDFs. Data is encrypted and shared directly between authorized entities through AAs, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.
9. OCEN, the Open Credit Enablement Network, aims to democratize credit access by enabling data-driven underwriting. It allows lenders to access a borrower's performance data from various sources with their consent, facilitating efficient and inclusive lending practices.
10. Criticisms of India Stack include concerns about data privacy and security, potential exclusion of vulnerable populations due to technical barriers, and the dominance of large technology companies within the UPI ecosystem.

### Essay Questions

1. Discuss the potential of India Stack to serve as a global model for digital infrastructure development. What lessons can other countries learn from India's experience?
2. Analyze the implications of DEPA for individual data rights and privacy. How does it balance the need for data sharing with the protection of personal information?
3. Critically evaluate the potential impact of UPI and OCEN on financial inclusion and economic growth in India.
4. Compare and contrast India's approach to digital identity (Aadhaar) with other national ID systems around the world. What are the advantages and disadvantages of India's model?
