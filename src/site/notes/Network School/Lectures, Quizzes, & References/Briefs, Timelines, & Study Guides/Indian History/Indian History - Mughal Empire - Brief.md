## Mughal Empire and British East India Company

This briefing doc reviews key themes and important facts from provided source materials on the Mughal Empire and its interaction with the British East India Company.

**Main Themes:**

- **Rise and Fall of the Mughal Empire:** The Mughal Empire's growth under emperors like Akbar the Great, fueled by military prowess and religious tolerance, is contrasted with its gradual decline under Aurangzeb's policies and the subsequent loss of control to the Marathas and eventually the British.
- **Religious Tolerance and Conflict:** Akbar's policy of incorporating Hindus into the administration and abolishing discriminatory taxes is highlighted. However, the re-imposition of the _jizya_ tax by Aurangzeb and his stricter religious policies are presented as contributing factors to the empire's decline.
- **Mughal Art and Architecture:** The sources emphasize the significant contributions of the Mughal period to Indian art and architecture, showcasing examples like the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri, and Mughal painting.
- **British East India Company's Ascendancy:** The East India Company's transition from a trading entity to a dominant force controlling large parts of India is traced. The Battle of Plassey emerges as a turning point, establishing British military and political control over Bengal and paving the way for their eventual rule over the subcontinent.

**Key Ideas and Facts:**

**Mughal Emperors:**

- **Akbar the Great (1556-1605):** Consolidated Mughal power, expanded the empire significantly, and implemented policies of religious tolerance, incorporating Hindus into the administration.
- _"One of the notable features of Akbarâ€™s government was the extent of Hindu, and particularly Rajput, participation."_
- _"Discrimination against non-Muslims was reduced by abolishing the taxation of pilgrims and the tax payable by non-Muslims (jizyah) in lieu of military service."_
- **Jahangir (1605-1627):** Continued his father's administrative system and tolerant religious policy.
- **Shah Jahan (1628-1658):** Known for architectural achievements, notably the Taj Mahal, built in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.
- **Aurangzeb (1658-1707):** Expanded the empire to its greatest extent but reversed Akbar's policy of religious tolerance, leading to revolts and weakening the empire.
- _"The first overt sign of change was the reimposition of the jizya, or poll tax, on non-Muslims in 1679 (a tax that had been abolished by Akbar)."_

**Key Events and Factors:**

- **Second Battle of Panipat (1556):** Akbar, under the regency of Bayram Khan, secures victory, ensuring his succession and solidifying Mughal rule.
- **Conquest of Rajputana:** Akbar uses a combination of military force and diplomacy to secure alliances with Rajput princes, incorporating them into the Mughal administration.
- **Expansion into the Deccan:** Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan lead campaigns to expand Mughal control southward into the Deccan plateau.
- **Aurangzeb's Policies:** His reversal of Akbar's tolerant policies, including the reimposition of the _jizya_, alienated Hindus and fueled rebellions, weakening the empire.
- **Rise of the Marathas:** Under leaders like Shivaji, the Marathas challenged Mughal authority in the Deccan, ultimately contributing to the decline of Mughal power.
- **Battle of Plassey (1757):** A decisive victory for the British East India Company led by Robert Clive against the Nawab of Bengal marks a turning point, paving the way for British dominance in India.
- **Indian Mutiny of 1857-58:** A widespread rebellion against British rule, triggered partly by controversies like the Enfield rifle cartridges, ultimately leads to the dissolution of the East India Company and the establishment of direct British rule.

**Mughal Art and Architecture:**

**British East India Company:**

- **Transformation from Trading Company to Political Power:** Initially focused on trade, the company increasingly engaged in military campaigns and political maneuvers, culminating in its control over vast swathes of India.
- **Exploitation and Monopoly:** The company's pursuit of profit led to exploitative practices, including its involvement in the opium trade with China.
- **Dissolution in 1873:** Following the Indian Mutiny, the British government dissolved the company and took direct control of India.
