## The Impact of the Golden Quadrilateral Highway Project in India

**Source:** Ghani, E., Goswami, A. G., & Kerr, W. (2013). Highway to success in India: the impact of the golden quadrilateral project for the location and performance of manufacturing. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 6320. As summarized in "The Golden Quadrilateral: Highway to success" published on Ideas for India.

**Main Themes:**

- **Impact of transport infrastructure on economic activity:** The paper examines the effects of the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) highway project on India's manufacturing sector, particularly its spatial distribution and performance.
- **Efficient distribution of industries:** The research explores how the GQ facilitated the relocation of industries, especially land and building-intensive ones, from urban centers to peripheries and medium-sized cities.
- **Role of connectivity in promoting growth:** The study highlights the positive effects of improved connectivity on entry rates, productivity, and overall manufacturing activity in areas near the GQ.

**Key Findings:**

- **Positive Impact on Manufacturing:** The GQ project spurred growth in the organized manufacturing sector, with substantial increases in new firm entries in districts within 10 km of the highway. This growth was observed in areas where the project upgraded existing highways and constructed new ones.
- "There appears to be substantial growth in entry rates in non-nodal districts within 10 km of the GQ network after the GQ upgrades."
- **Shift in Industrial Location:** The improved connectivity facilitated the movement of land and building-intensive industries from nodal districts (major cities) to non-nodal districts closer to the GQ. This shift, attributed to efficient resource allocation, is particularly significant in the context of India's complex land market regulations.
- "This pattern - where some industries move from urban to rural areas or from core to peripheries of cities - is evident in many countries, and is associated with the efficient placement of industries."
- **Growth of Medium-Sized Cities:** The GQ project played a role in making medium-density districts more attractive for manufacturing activity. Moderate-density districts along the GQ experienced significant increases in new output and establishments.
- "GQ upgrades have increased the number of new entries the most in high- and medium-density districts that lie 0-10km from the GQ network."

**Important Facts:**

- The Golden Quadrilateral connects Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata and is the fifth-longest highway in the world.
- The study focuses on non-nodal districts (those excluding the four major cities) and compares those within 10km of the GQ to those 10-50km away.
- The research uses plant-level data from 312 districts, covering over 90% of the manufacturing sector in India.

**Quotes:**

- "Transport investments within cities and across cities are essential for economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction."
- "Given Indiaâ€™s distorted land markets, the movement of land and building intensive industries brought about by the heightened connectivity through GQ may be particularly important for the efficient sorting of industry across spatial locations."
- "These results suggest that the improved connectivity enables manufacturing establishments to efficiently locate in cities with medium population density, but that agglomeration economies prevalent for the sector discourage entry in low-density places."

**Conclusion:**

The Golden Quadrilateral highway project has demonstrably impacted the spatial distribution and performance of India's manufacturing sector. By improving connectivity, it has facilitated the efficient allocation of resources, promoted growth in medium-sized cities, and potentially mitigated distortions in the land market. This research highlights the crucial role of infrastructure development in driving economic growth and shaping regional development patterns.
