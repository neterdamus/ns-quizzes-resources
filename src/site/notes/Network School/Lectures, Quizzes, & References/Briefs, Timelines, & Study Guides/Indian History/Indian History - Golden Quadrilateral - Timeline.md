## Timeline of Events:

**Early 2000s:**

- **2001:** Construction of the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) highway project begins in India. This ambitious project aims to connect the four major cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, improving connectivity and boosting economic growth.

**Mid 2000s:**

- **2005:** The GQ project reaches two-thirds completion, marking significant progress in upgrading India's national highway network.

**Late 2000s:**

- **2007:** The GQ project is largely finished, creating the fifth-longest highway in the world and significantly enhancing connectivity between major Indian cities.

**Post GQ Completion:**

- **Following years:** Researchers begin to study the impact of the GQ project, observing significant changes in the spatial distribution of industries, particularly manufacturing.
- Increased entry rates of new manufacturing firms in districts located within 10km of the GQ network.
- Shift of land and building intensive industries from urban centers to areas near the GQ network.
- Growth in manufacturing activity and productivity in districts near the GQ network.
- Increased attractiveness of medium-density cities for manufacturing establishments.

**Concurrent Development:**

- **Early 2000s:** The North-South East-West (NS-EW) highway, another major infrastructure project in India, is planned for a partial upgrade alongside the GQ project. However, this upgrade faces delays.
- **Post-GQ Completion:** The upgrade of the NS-EW highway is eventually undertaken. However, research does not find similar economic impacts along the NS-EW highway compared to those observed along the GQ network.
