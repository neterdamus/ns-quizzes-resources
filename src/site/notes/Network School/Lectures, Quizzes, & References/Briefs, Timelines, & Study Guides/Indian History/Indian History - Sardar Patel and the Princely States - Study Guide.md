### Quiz Answer Key

1. Sardar Patel served as the Home Minister in the Interim Government and became India's first Deputy Prime Minister, taking on the crucial portfolio of States to oversee the integration of princely states.
2. Most princely states were governed by autocratic rulers, with little to no semblance of democracy. The ruler's will was law, starkly contrasting with the responsible government systems developing in British Indian provinces.
3. The States Department aimed to secure the accession of princely states to India in matters of defence, foreign affairs, and communications, while also maintaining existing agreements through Standstill Agreements. V.P. Menon, the department's Secretary, effectively implemented Sardar Patel's policies.
4. Jinnah opposed the states' accession to India and attempted to lure some, particularly border states, to join Pakistan. However, he faced resistance from nobles and growing anti-Muslim sentiment fueled by the refugee crisis.
5. Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad, and Junagadh presented the most significant challenges. Junagadh was integrated after a plebiscite, Hyderabad through military intervention, and Jammu and Kashmir's integration involved a protracted conflict with Pakistan.
6. While partition resulted in the loss of 3.6 lakh square miles and 81.5 million people, the integration of states added 5 lakh square miles and 86.5 million people to India.
7. Bamzai portrays Nehru as the visionary who initiated the dismantling of princely power, driven by his socialist ideals and negative experiences with rulers. Mountbatten acted as the facilitator, utilizing his influence to dismantle the existing order. Patel, the skilled administrator, executed the plan with firmness and efficiency.
8. Nehru's Fabian Socialist ideology and his imprisonment in Nabha in the 1920s fueled his dislike for the autocratic rule prevalent in princely states.
9. Nehru highlighted Patel's qualities as a leader in the freedom struggle, a wise advisor, a dependable colleague, and a source of strength and encouragement.
