## Short-Answer Answer Key

1. The "Hindu rate of growth" was a term used to describe India's slow GDP growth rate, averaging around 3.5% per year from 1950 to 1980. This was largely attributed to socialist policies and excessive government control over the economy. After the economic reforms of 1991, India's growth rate accelerated significantly, reaching an average of 8% since 2003.
2. Before 1991, India pursued "economic independence" by aiming for self-sufficiency and minimizing foreign trade and investment, fearing economic domination. This resulted in a sharp decline in India's share of global trade. After 1991, India embraced globalization and opened its economy, leading to a surge in imports and exports.
3. "Jugaad" refers to innovative problem-solving, often using limited resources and unconventional methods. It exemplifies Indian ingenuity in overcoming obstacles. It can involve frugal engineering, as seen in the creation of low-cost vehicles or medical devices, but it can also encompass forms of corruption and tax evasion to navigate bureaucratic hurdles.
4. The National Stock Exchange, established in the 1990s, brought much-needed transparency and efficiency to the Indian stock market. Its fully electronic platform with automated matching of bids and offers minimized opportunities for manipulation and rigging. It also introduced stricter regulations, faster settlement periods (T+2), and dematerialization of shares, making the market more reliable and attractive to investors.
5. Key social indicators include literacy rate, life expectancy, infant mortality, and malnutrition levels. While India has seen improvements in these areas, its progress has lagged behind that of some of its South Asian neighbors. This is attributed to persistent poverty, inequalities, and inadequate delivery of government services in education, healthcare, and sanitation.
6. "Neo-illiberalism" refers to the phenomenon in India where, despite economic liberalization, new forms of control, regulations, and bureaucratic hurdles have emerged. While old licensing regimes were dismantled, new regulations in areas like the environment, land acquisition, and labor laws have created fresh challenges for businesses.
7. The criminalization of politics, where individuals with criminal records are elected to office, has eroded trust in governance and the rule of law. This allows influential figures to evade accountability and perpetuates a culture of impunity. It also hampers efforts to improve the police and judicial systems, as powerful politicians can influence investigations and trials.
8. Government failure in service delivery is evident in areas like education, healthcare, and the judicial system. Teacher absenteeism in government schools, inadequate funding and poor infrastructure in healthcare, and a massive backlog of cases in the courts demonstrate the inefficiency and lack of accountability in public services.
9. India's infrastructure challenges stem from various factors, including bureaucratic delays in land acquisition and environmental clearances, funding constraints, and political interference in project implementation. The failure of public-private partnerships in many infrastructure sectors further exacerbated the problem.
10. India's demographic dividend, with a growing working-age population, presents both opportunities and challenges. It offers a potential boost to economic growth if the young workforce is equipped with the necessary skills. However, the current education system struggles to provide quality education and relevant skills training, leading to a mismatch between the skills available and those required by the industry.
