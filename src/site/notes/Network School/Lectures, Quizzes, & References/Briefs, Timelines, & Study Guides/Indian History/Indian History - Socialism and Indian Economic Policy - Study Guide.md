**Answer Key**

1. Socialist ideas influenced Indian economic policy through the impact of external socialist ideologies on elite groups and the political pressure exerted by left-wing parties on the dominant Congress Party.
2. Fabian-type gradualism in India meant a gradual transition to public ownership through increased public sector investment over successive five-year plans, rather than immediate nationalization of existing private assets.
3. The Soviet model influenced India's Second Five-Year Plan by emphasizing heavy industry, detailed industrial targeting, and comprehensive industrial licensing, all contributing to a centrally planned approach.
4. Industrial licensing aimed to regulate the composition of industrial production and investment, and prevent the concentration of economic power in a limited number of large industrial houses. However, it led to inefficiencies and rent-seeking.
5. Indian economic policy focused on raising minimum incomes through rapid economic growth, believing this would create jobs and benefit the poor more effectively than immediate redistribution of consumption.
6. The Indian government regulated private foreign investment closely, directing it to specific areas due to concerns stemming from the colonial experience, despite the limited threat of foreign economic domination given India's size.
7. Public consumption expenditures on education and health aimed to improve human capital and supplement the growth of private consumption as the economy expanded, contributing to poverty alleviation in the long run.
8. Key components of land reform included abolishing absentee landlordism, securing tenancy rights, imposing land ceilings to reduce ownership concentration, and promoting cooperative farming and marketing.
9. A "rentier society" refers to an economic system where profits and wealth are generated primarily through control of existing assets and resources, rather than through productive activities. In India, licensing and controls contributed to this phenomenon.
10. "First-round socialism" describes seemingly socialist measures that are ultimately subverted or fail to achieve their intended socialist goals. In India, this resulted from a lack of genuine commitment to socialist principles within the ruling class.

**Essay Questions**

1. Analyze the impact of Fabian and Soviet socialist thought on the development of India's economic policies in the early years of independence. Compare and contrast their influences.
2. To what extent did the Indian government's economic policies succeed in achieving both efficiency and equity? Evaluate the performance of the public and private sectors in the context of these goals.
3. Critically examine the role of industrial licensing in the Indian economy. Discuss its intended objectives, its actual consequences, and its impact on economic growth and income distribution.
4. Analyze the successes and failures of India's land reform policies. To what extent did they contribute to agricultural growth and poverty reduction? What factors hindered their effectiveness?
5. Assess the argument that India's socialist pattern was more "patter" than substance. Consider the political and economic factors that shaped the implementation of socialist policies, and evaluate the outcomes in terms of achieving genuine socialist objectives.
