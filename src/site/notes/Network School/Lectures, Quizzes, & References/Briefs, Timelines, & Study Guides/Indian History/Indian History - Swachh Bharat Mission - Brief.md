## Briefing Doc: Impact of Swachh Bharat Mission on Infant Mortality in India

**Source:** Chakrabarti, S., Gune, S., Bruckner, T.A. _et al._ Toilet construction under the Swachh Bharat Mission and infant mortality in India. _Sci Rep_ **14**, 20340 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-71268-8

**Main Theme:** This study investigates the impact of India's national sanitation campaign, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), on infant and child mortality rates.

**Key Findings:**

- **Robust Inverse Relationship:** A strong inverse correlation exists between toilet access and child mortality in India, both historically and in the context of the SBM.
- **Significant Mortality Reduction:** Districts with over 30% toilet coverage under SBM witnessed a significant reduction in infant mortality rate (IMR) by 5.3 points and under-five mortality rate (U5MR) by 6.7 points per 1000.
- **Estimated Lives Saved:** Based on the study's findings, the SBM is estimated to have contributed to saving approximately 60,000-70,000 infant lives annually.
- **Threshold Effect:** The study observes a threshold effect, indicating that substantial reductions in IMR and U5MR occur when toilet coverage reaches 30% or higher at the district level.
- **Synergistic Effects:** The effectiveness of SBM is potentially enhanced by India's existing primary health care infrastructure and synergistic programming aspects of the campaign, beyond toilet construction.
- **Interaction with Health Services:** Districts with higher existing vaccination coverage showed smaller SBM benefits, highlighting the importance of comprehensive healthcare access in maximizing sanitation benefits.

**Important Quotes:**

- "Toilet access and child mortality have a historically robust inverse association in India."
- "Results from panel data regression models show that districts with > 30% toilets constructed under SBM corresponds with 5.3 lower IMR (_p_ < 0.05), and 6.8 lower U5MR (_p_ < 0.05)."
- "The post-SBM period in India exhibited accelerated reductions in infant and child mortality compared to the pre-SBM years."

**Methodology:**

- **Data Source:** The study analyzed data from multiple nationally representative surveys, including the District Level Household Surveys (DLHS), National Family Health Surveys (NFHS), and the Indian Census Bureau's vital registration system (VRS), spanning 20 years.
- **Study Design:** The study employed a quasi-experimental design, using the phased rollout of SBM as a plausibly exogenous programmatic exposure.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Two-way fixed effects regression models were used to analyze the association between SBM coverage and IMR/U5MR, controlling for various sociodemographic, wealth, and healthcare-related confounders.
- **Robustness Checks:** Placebo tests, falsification tests, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to strengthen the internal validity of the study's findings.

**Limitations:**

- **Potential Endogeneity:** The study acknowledges potential endogeneity issues due to the non-random distribution of SBM intensity among districts. However, the use of TWFE analysis and robustness checks aim to minimize confounding bias.
- **Data Aggregation:** Using district-level data might mask variations in program implementation and outcomes within districts.
- **Unmeasured Confounders:** The possibility of unmeasured confounders influencing the relationship between SBM and mortality cannot be completely ruled out.

**Implications:**

- **Policy Relevance:** This study provides robust evidence supporting the efficacy of large-scale sanitation programs like SBM in reducing child mortality in LMICs.
- **Public Health Significance:** The findings underscore the importance of sanitation as a crucial public health intervention, alongside other preventive and curative health services.
- **Future Research:** Further research is needed to explore long-term changes in toilet use and its sustained impact on child mortality.

**Overall Conclusion:** This research significantly contributes to understanding the impact of sanitation interventions on child health. It demonstrates the potential of comprehensive national sanitation programs like SBM to achieve substantial reductions in infant and child mortality, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes in LMICs.
