### Short Answer Quiz Answer Key

1. The collective leadership was comprised of Leonid Brezhnev as party first secretary, Aleksey Kosygin as prime minister, and Nikolay Podgorny as president. This triumvirate aimed to provide stability and address the economic and political challenges facing the Soviet Union.
2. Brezhnev consolidated his power gradually, initially focusing on party personnel decisions. He capitalized on foreign policy events like the Czechoslovakian crisis to increase his authority and sideline Kosygin's economic influence. By the mid-1970s, he became the undisputed leader, assuming the presidency in 1977.
3. "Developed socialism" was Brezhnev's ideological response to the unrealized promises of Khrushchev's communist era. It implied that the transition to full communism would be longer and more complex than initially anticipated, justifying continued social differentiation and party control.
4. Kosygin aimed to increase enterprise independence and efficiency, but his reforms were hampered by the central planning system's continued control over resource allocation. Growing conservatism after the 1968 Czechoslovakian intervention further stifled meaningful economic change.
5. The Soviet economy experienced initial growth in the 1960s, but this stagnated by the 1970s. Factors contributing to the decline included over-reliance on heavy industry and the military, declining agricultural productivity, and a lack of worker motivation due to limited incentives and innovation.
6. Brezhnev favored conservative cultural expression that glorified the Soviet system and suppressed dissident voices. Artists and writers faced censorship, imprisonment, and exile for challenging the official narrative, leading to the trials of figures like Sinyavsky, Daniel, and the eventual expulsion of Solzhenitsyn.
7. As official culture stagnated under censorship, a vibrant counterculture emerged. This included the underground circulation of banned literature (samizdat), publication abroad (tamizdat), and the embrace of Western music and ideas, facilitated by foreign language education and the availability of cassette technology.
8. Brezhnev's nationality policy promoted Russian dominance and the homogenization of Soviet culture. This led to the suppression of national identities, particularly in Ukraine and the Baltic republics, through language policies favoring Russian and the purging of local cultural figures.
9. The Brezhnev Doctrine, established after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, asserted the Soviet Union's right to intervene in socialist countries deemed to be straying from the Soviet model. It reflected Moscow's determination to maintain control over its satellite states and prevent challenges to its hegemony.
10. Successes of Brezhnev's foreign policy included achieving détente with the US, marked by arms limitation treaties and the Helsinki Accords. However, failures included the costly intervention in Afghanistan, strained relations with China, and the economic burden of the arms race, which contributed to the Soviet Union's eventual decline.
