### Answer Key

1. A "frozen conflict" refers to a situation where active armed conflict has ended but no formal peace treaty or political resolution has been reached, leaving the underlying issues unresolved and the potential for renewed violence present.
2. Stalin's policies of redrawing internal borders, suppressing nationalist sentiments, and forcibly relocating ethnic groups created divisions and tensions that resurfaced after the Soviet collapse. These artificial borders and forced migrations led to ethnic and territorial disputes that fueled the frozen conflicts.
3. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a power vacuum and weakened central control, allowing long-suppressed ethnic and nationalist tensions to erupt into violence as different groups sought independence or control over disputed territories.
4. Russia has played a complex and controversial role, deploying "peacekeeping" forces to some regions like Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. Critics argue that these deployments are a form of occupation and that Russia uses these conflicts to maintain influence and prevent these regions from aligning with the West.
5. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict centers around the predominantly Armenian population of the region seeking unification with Armenia, while Azerbaijan claims the territory as its own. The main points of contention are the status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the control of surrounding territories.
6. Transnistria's conflict is unique because it was primarily driven by political and economic motivations rather than purely ethnic tensions. The region's largely Russian and Ukrainian population feared Moldova's potential reunification with Romania and sought to remain within the Soviet Union.
7. Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia in 1999 after a war in the early 1990s. The conflict stemmed from Abkhazia's desire for autonomy and fears of Georgian nationalism. Ethnic tensions, fueled by the collapse of the Soviet Union, escalated into violence.
8. The 2008 war was triggered by Georgia's military incursion into South Ossetia, attempting to reassert control over the breakaway region. Russia, which supported South Ossetia's independence, responded with a large-scale military intervention, driving Georgian forces out and recognizing South Ossetia's independence.
9. Resolving these conflicts is crucial for fostering regional stability, promoting economic development, and improving the lives of people affected by the conflicts. Unresolved conflicts hinder trade, investment, and cooperation, and keep the region vulnerable to instability and renewed violence.
10. Challenges to peace include entrenched nationalist sentiments, distrust between parties, the involvement of external actors with competing interests, the difficulty of finding mutually acceptable compromises on issues like territorial integrity and self-determination, and the lack of political will to make concessions.

### Essay Questions

1. Analyze the role of nationalism in the emergence and persistence of the post-Soviet frozen conflicts. How has the concept of self-determination contributed to both the outbreak of violence and the challenges of achieving lasting peace?
2. To what extent is Russia responsible for the continuation of the frozen conflicts? Evaluate the arguments for and against Russiaâ€™s involvement and assess its impact on the prospects for resolution.
3. Compare and contrast the Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria conflicts, highlighting the key similarities and differences in their causes, dynamics, and potential paths to resolution.
4. Examine the impact of the frozen conflicts on the social, economic, and political development of the affected regions. How have these conflicts hindered progress and what opportunities might arise from their peaceful resolution?
5. Evaluate the role of international organizations, such as the OSCE and the EU, in attempting to mediate and resolve the post-Soviet frozen conflicts. What are the strengths and limitations of their approaches, and what strategies might be more effective in achieving lasting peace?
