## Cast of Characters

**Mikhail Gorbachev:** The final leader of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev initiated _perestroika_ and _glasnost_ to reform the stagnating Soviet system. He aimed for economic revitalization and political openness, but his reforms ultimately contributed to the Soviet Union's collapse.

**Boris Yeltsin:** A charismatic and ambitious politician who rose to prominence during the Gorbachev era. He served as the first president of the Russian Federation and played a key role in dismantling the Soviet Union. Yeltsin was known for his populist appeal, his criticism of the Communist Party, and his advocacy for Russian sovereignty.

**Yury V. Andropov:** Leader of the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1984. He focused on restoring discipline and fighting corruption but did not implement significant economic reforms.

**Konstantin Chernenko:** Successor to Andropov, leading the Soviet Union briefly from 1984 to 1985. His leadership was marked by a continuation of Brezhnev-era policies and a lack of effective solutions to the growing economic crisis.

**Kosygin:** A key figure in the Soviet leadership until his death in 1980. His death, along with Brezhnev's declining health, created a power vacuum within the aging leadership.

**Yegor Ligachev:** A conservative member of the Politburo who initially supported Gorbachev but later became a key opponent to his reforms. Ligachev headed the Central Committee Secretariat, a powerful position that Gorbachev eventually weakened.

**Grigory A. Yavlinsky:** A prominent economist who advised Gorbachev on economic reforms. Yavlinsky advocated for a full transition to a market economy, but Gorbachev hesitated to implement such radical changes.
