**Answer Key**

1. Khrushchev's main purpose was to denounce Stalin's abuses of power and initiate a process of de-Stalinization within the Soviet Union. He aimed to distance the Communist Party from Stalin's legacy and promote a return to a more idealized Leninist model.
2. Khrushchev cited numerous examples, including the Great Purge of the mid-1930s, where innocent communists were falsely accused and punished, often executed after being tortured. He also highlighted Stalin's irrational deportation of entire nationality groups during World War II.
3. Khrushchev criticized Stalin for failing to prepare adequately for the German invasion, weakening the Red Army through purges of its officers, and mismanaging the war effort.
4. The "cult of personality" referred to the excessive glorification of Stalin as an infallible leader. Khrushchev condemned it as a distortion of communist principles and a tool for Stalin to consolidate his power.
5. Khrushchev primarily focused on Stalin's abuses against the Communist Party, downplaying the mass terror inflicted on the general population. He also did not criticize Stalin's actions before 1934, including the collectivization campaign and political struggles against rivals.
6. Lenin's Testament was a document in which Lenin warned about Stalin's potential for abusing power. Khrushchev referenced it in his speech to legitimize his criticisms and present them as aligned with Lenin's original vision.
7. The speech was delivered to a closed session of the Communist Party Congress and later read to select groups of party activists. Despite its secrecy, it spread through informal channels and had a significant impact due to its shocking revelations about Stalin's rule.
8. The "Khrushchev Thaw" was a period of liberalization in the Soviet Union following Stalin's death, characterized by relaxed censorship and political reforms. The secret speech contributed to this thaw by undermining Stalin's authority and creating space for criticism and dissent.
9. The speech caused shock and disillusionment throughout the Soviet bloc, leading to revolts in Hungary and Poland later in 1956. These events challenged Soviet control and exposed the fragility of its authority in the region.
10. Historians suggest Khrushchev aimed to consolidate his own leadership by aligning himself with reform while discrediting rivals implicated in Stalin's crimes. He may have also sought to distance the Communist Party from Stalin's legacy and present a more positive image to the world.
