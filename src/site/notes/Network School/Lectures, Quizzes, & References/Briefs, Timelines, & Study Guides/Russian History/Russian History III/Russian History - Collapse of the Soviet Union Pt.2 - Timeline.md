## Timeline of the Fall of the Soviet Union

**1953:** Joseph Stalin dies. Georgi Malenkov succeeds him, followed shortly by Nikita Khrushchev.

**1956:** Khrushchev delivers his "Secret Speech" denouncing Stalin's regime and initiating the period of "de-Stalinization" and the "Thaw". Reforms include releasing political prisoners and shifting foreign policy towards peaceful co-existence. Anti-communist uprisings occur in Eastern Europe, notably in Hungary and East Germany, leading to Soviet suppression and a slowdown of liberalization.

**1958:** Khrushchev becomes Prime Minister.

**1964:** Leonid Brezhnev replaces Khrushchev, reversing many of the reforms and recentralizing power.

**1968:** The Brezhnev Doctrine is established, justifying Soviet intervention in other communist countries to maintain the communist cause. Warsaw Pact troops invade Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague Spring reform movement.

**1972:** The US and USSR sign the SALT-I treaty, limiting nuclear weapons.

**1979:**

- The US and USSR sign the SALT-II treaty (though it is never ratified by the US Senate).
- The Soviet Union invades Afghanistan to support a communist government facing rebellion and internal conflict.

**1980:** The US boycotts the Moscow Olympics in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

**1985:** Mikhail Gorbachev becomes General Secretary of the Communist Party and launches the policies of Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring).

**1989:**

- The Soviet Union withdraws from Afghanistan after a decade of war.
- The Baltic states (Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania) demand independence.

**1990:**

- The Communist Party votes to end one-party rule.
- The Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR) declares its sovereignty and holds its first free elections, with Boris Yeltsin becoming President.

**August 1991:** Hardline members of the Communist Party attempt a coup against Gorbachev, which fails due to lack of popular and military support.

**December 24, 1991:** Gorbachev resigns. The Soviet Union is formally dissolved and Boris Yeltsin becomes the first President of the newly independent Russian Federation.
