## Timeline of Events

This timeline focuses on the waves of arrests and significant events in the Soviet Union, primarily during Stalin’s rule, based on the excerpt from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s _The Gulag Archipelago_.

**Pre-1929:**

- **1918-1921:** The first wave of arrests targets members of the defeated opposition parties, including the Kadets, Socialist Revolutionaries, and Mensheviks.
- **1921:** The Workers Opposition is condemned at the Tenth Party Congress.

**1929-1939:**

- **1929-1930:** The largest wave of arrests targets millions of “kulaks” (prosperous peasants), resulting in their forced resettlement.
- **1930-1933:** Waves of arrests coincide with specific decrees, including those targeting: “saboteurs” in technical fields, private traders, and those involved in the “gold” affair.
- **1931:** Stalin unexpectedly halts preparations for a massive show trial of the “Working Peasants Party.”
- **1936-1938:** The “Great Purge” sees a significant increase in arrests, often based on fabricated charges and quotas assigned to security forces. Show trials of prominent Bolsheviks, like Zinoviev and Kamenev, take place.

**1940s:**

- **Early 1940s:** A wave of arrests targets those returning from the West, accused of praising foreign technology and democracy.

- **Post-War:** The return of Soviet prisoners of war and those who served in Vlasov's army leads to mass arrests.

**1950s:**

- **1950s:** Continued waves of arrests focus on specific decrees and perceived threats. Solzhenitsyn is arrested in 1945.
