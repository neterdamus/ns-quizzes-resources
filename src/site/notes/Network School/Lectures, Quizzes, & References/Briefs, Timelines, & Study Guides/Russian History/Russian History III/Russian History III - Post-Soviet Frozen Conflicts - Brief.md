## Post-Soviet Frozen Conflicts

This briefing document examines the main themes and crucial facts surrounding the enduring post-Soviet frozen conflicts, primarily drawing from the Per Concordiam article "Post-Soviet Frozen Conflicts". The document explores the origins, key players, and potential resolutions of these complex geopolitical issues.

**Origins Rooted in Soviet Legacy:**

The article emphasizes that the root cause of these frozen conflicts lies in the Soviet Union's nationalities policy, particularly during Stalin's era. Artificial borders were drawn, dividing ethnic groups and forcibly transferring populations, a strategy intended to weaken nationalist sentiment and ensure loyalty to the Soviet state. However, this approach backfired, creating a powder keg of ethnic tensions that exploded with the USSR's disintegration.

_"Joseph Stalin: Map-maker... artificial borders were drawn, splitting ethnic groups and combining some with others... The policy was meant to weaken nationalist and ethnic ties and foster loyalty to the multinational Soviet state."_

**The Four Frozen Conflicts:**

The article focuses on four specific frozen conflicts:

- **Nagorno-Karabakh:** Predominantly Armenian population seeking unification with Armenia, locked in conflict with Azerbaijan. The bloodiest of the conflicts with a death toll estimated between 15,000 to 30,000.
- **Transnistria:** Primarily Russian and Ukrainian population seeking separation from Moldova, driven by economic factors and a desire to remain within the Soviet sphere. Unique in its political rather than purely ethnic character.
- **Abkhazia:** Conflict rooted in ethnic divisions and Abkhazia's desire for independence from Georgia. Utilized the 2008 Russo-Georgian War to solidify its de facto independence.
- **South Ossetia:** Seeking secession from Georgia and unification with North Ossetia in Russia. Similar to Abkhazia, it leveraged the 2008 war to further its independence ambitions.

**Russia's Role: A Double-Edged Sword:**

Russia plays a crucial, albeit controversial, role in these conflicts. It acted as a mediator for ceasefires and deployed “peacekeeping” forces in Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. However, its presence is often viewed as an occupation by the respective countries. Furthermore, Russia's heavy economic and military support for the separatist regimes, particularly in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, raises concerns about its true intentions.

_"Russia helped negotiate the cease-fires and deployed “peacekeeping” troops to Transnistria, Abkhazia and south ossetia in 1992-93, though Moldova and Georgia have long considered their presence an occupation of their sovereign territory."_

Some analysts, like Dmitri Trenin, suggest that Russia uses these frozen conflicts to impede NATO enlargement, citing the examples of Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova.

**Consequences and the Price of Peace:**

These unresolved conflicts present significant consequences:

- **Humanitarian Crisis:** Thousands have been killed and displaced, creating ongoing suffering and instability.
- **Organized Crime:** Weak governance and corruption within these territories provide safe havens for criminal activities, including trafficking.
- **Obstacles to Development:** The conflicts hinder regional development, trade, and economic growth.

The international community faces the challenge of balancing the principles of territorial integrity and self-determination. Achieving lasting peace necessitates compromise and understanding from all parties involved.

**Looking Ahead:**

While some progress has been observed, especially in the case of Transnistria and Moldova, the overall outlook remains uncertain. The potential for renewed conflict, particularly in Nagorno-Karabakh, is a persistent concern. Ultimately, resolving these frozen conflicts requires a concerted effort from regional leaders and international actors, including the EU, Russia, and the US, to find a lasting and peaceful solution that addresses the complex historical, political, and ethnic factors at play.
