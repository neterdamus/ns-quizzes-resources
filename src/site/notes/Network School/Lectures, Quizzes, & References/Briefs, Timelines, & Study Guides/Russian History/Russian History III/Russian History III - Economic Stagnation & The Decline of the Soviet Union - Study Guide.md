### Short Answer Key

1. **Economic stagnation refers to a prolonged period of little or no economic growth. In the Soviet Union, this occurred in the 1970s and 1980s due to factors like centralized planning failures, bureaucratic inefficiencies, excessive military spending, and resource shortages.**
2. **Initially, centralized planning allowed the Soviet Union to rapidly industrialize. However, as the economy grew more complex, the centralized system became too rigid and bureaucratic. Decision-making was slow, and the system couldn't adapt to changing conditions or local needs.**
3. **Liberman proposed decentralizing the economy and reintroducing profit incentives to boost productivity and efficiency. While some aspects were implemented in agriculture and light industry, the reforms faced resistance from communist hardliners who feared losing control.**
4. **External factors impacting the Soviet economy included the US abandoning the gold standard in 1971 and the 1973 OPEC oil crisis. These events destabilized global markets and made it more difficult for the Soviet Union to trade and manage its economy.**
5. **Prioritizing military and industrial needs led to shortages of consumer goods and food for ordinary citizens. This resulted in long queues, limited choices, and a lower standard of living compared to the West.**
6. **The Soviet Union's agricultural sector struggled to keep up with demand, leading to grain shortages. This forced the government to rely on imports, including from Western nations, causing embarrassment and a significant trade deficit.**
7. **The 1986 Chernobyl disaster, caused by design flaws and human error at a nuclear power plant, led to a major release of radioactive material. The cleanup and containment efforts cost the Soviet government an estimated 20 billion rubles, further straining its already weak economy.**
8. **The Soviet war in Afghanistan drained the economy, costing an estimated $50 billion. It also led to increased tensions with the West and contributed to the growth of a black market for smuggled goods within the Soviet Union.**
9. **By the early 1980s, the Soviet economy was clearly in decline. The failures of previous attempts at reform, coupled with worsening living standards and external pressures, made it clear that major structural changes were urgently needed.**
10. **Mikhail Gorbachev was a relatively young and reform-minded leader who came to power in 1985. His background as an efficient administrator and his willingness to engage with the West led to hope that he could implement the necessary reforms to revitalize the Soviet economy.**
