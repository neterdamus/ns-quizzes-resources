## Collapse of the Soviet Union

**Main Themes:**

- **Nationalism:** The rise of nationalist movements in the Baltic republics and other Soviet republics, particularly Ukraine, played a key role in the USSR's disintegration. These movements capitalized on Gorbachev's reforms to demand greater autonomy and ultimately independence.
- **Economic Crisis:** The Soviet economy was in a state of deep crisis, marked by shortages, inflation, and a growing dependence on Western credits. The failure of Gorbachev's economic reforms, coupled with the rise of separatism, further destabilized the situation.
- **Gorbachev's Leadership:** Gorbachev's attempts to reform the Soviet system (perestroika and glasnost) inadvertently unleashed forces he couldn't control. His indecision, temporizing, and reliance on the US for support ultimately weakened his position and led to his downfall.
- **Yeltsin's Rise:** Boris Yeltsin emerged as a powerful figure, capitalizing on popular discontent and championing Russia's sovereignty. His alliance with the Baltic republics and his decisive actions during the August 1991 coup positioned him to take over the reins of power.
- **Russia's Primacy:** Yeltsin was determined to establish Russia as the primary successor state to the Soviet Union, inheriting its nuclear arsenal and global assets. This ambition led to tensions with other republics, particularly Ukraine.
- **Western Role:** Western powers, particularly the US, played a complex role in the Soviet collapse. They provided some economic support to Gorbachev but also encouraged the independence of the Baltic republics and prioritized their relationships with Eastern Europe.

**Important Ideas/Facts:**

- **Baltic Separatism:** The Baltic republics (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) took advantage of Gorbachev's reforms to demand independence. Their successful struggle emboldened other republics and exposed the weakness of the central Soviet state.

_“The Balts came to the Congress in force: almost a hundred pro-independence men and women. Their goal in Moscow was to agitate via the Soviet main media, cultivate allies and sympathizers, and do everything to delegitimize the use of force in domestic conflicts.”_

- **The Russian Question:** The rise of nationalism in other republics prompted questions about Russia's own sovereignty within the USSR.

_"In view of national movements in the Baltic republics, Ukraine, and elsewhere, however, the RSFSR began increasingly to look like the 'home' of Russians."_

- **Economic Chaos:** The Soviet economy was plagued by shortages, inflation, and a loss of control over finances.

_"How could there be two competing centers of money supply in one economy?"_ - _Viktor Gerashchenko on the establishment of the Bank of Russia._

- **Failed Coup:** The August 1991 coup, led by hardliners opposed to Gorbachev's reforms, backfired spectacularly. It exposed the weakness of the central government and ultimately led to the collapse of the USSR.
- **Yeltsin's Actions:** Yeltsin's defiance of the coup, his alliance with the Baltic republics, and his decision to ban the Communist Party in Russia were key moments that accelerated the Soviet Union's demise.

_“At that moment, Yeltsin dictated to Gorbachev what to do and where to add his signature.”_ - _Rein Müllerson on Yeltsin's recognition of Baltic independence._

- **Birth of the CIS:** The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was hastily formed as a loose association of former Soviet republics. Its establishment marked the formal end of the USSR.
- **The Nuclear Question:** The control over the Soviet nuclear arsenal became a major concern as the USSR disintegrated. Ultimately, Russia inherited the majority of the weapons, but the process was fraught with tension and potential danger.

_"Perfectly sensible Russians froth at the mouth if it is suggested that the Ukraine (from which they all trace their history) might go off on its own."_ - _Rodric Braithwaite on the sensitivity of the Ukrainian question for Russians._

- **Legacy of Collapse:** The collapse of the Soviet Union had profound geopolitical and economic consequences, reshaping the global order and leaving a legacy of unresolved conflicts and tensions, particularly in the post-Soviet space.

**Quotes:**

- **“So we’re on our own?”** - A Lithuanian representative to the US ambassador, Jack Matlock, highlighting the lack of US commitment to intervene against potential Soviet military action.
- **“I feel that you want to disband everything.”** - Nikolai Ryzhkov to Alexander Yakovlev, reflecting the growing concern within the Soviet leadership about the centrifugal forces unleashed by Gorbachev's reforms.
- **“Take a billion and a half in ready cash; take it before we reconsider.”** - James Baker to Gorbachev's interpreter, highlighting the West's pragmatic approach and potentially missed opportunities for greater economic assistance to the USSR.
- **“Unfortunately, we have 1,000 different understandings of ‘independence.’”** - A. N. Yakovlev to George Bush, foreshadowing the complexities and challenges of the post-Soviet transition.

**Conclusion:**

The collapse of the Soviet Union was a complex event with multiple contributing factors. Zubok's "Collapse" provides a detailed account of the events, highlighting the interplay of nationalistic aspirations, economic turmoil, and political maneuvering that ultimately led to the USSR's demise. The book also sheds light on the role of key individuals, such as Gorbachev and Yeltsin, and the complex dynamics between the Soviet Union and the West during this pivotal period
