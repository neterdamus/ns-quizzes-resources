### Short Answer Key

1. Khrushchev's "thaw" aimed to de-Stalinize the USSR, promoting peaceful coexistence with the West and internal liberalization. It led to reduced political repression but also sparked anti-communist uprisings, forcing a slowdown in reforms.
2. The Brezhnev Doctrine asserted the right of communist states to intervene in others to safeguard the communist cause. It justified the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, suppressing the Prague Spring reforms and reinforcing Soviet control over satellite states.
3. SALT I and II aimed to limit nuclear arms proliferation. SALT I limited ABMs and ICBMs, while SALT II set specific limits on missile types. They represented attempts at d√©tente but were undermined by events like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
4. The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to secure its strategic position, protect its interests in the region, and quell the mujahideen insurgency. The invasion proved costly, draining the Soviet economy, tarnishing its image, and fueling international condemnation.
5. The Soviet-Afghan War strained the Soviet economy, already struggling with inefficiencies. It exposed the weaknesses of the Soviet military and eroded public trust in the government. International backlash further isolated the Soviet Union.
6. Glasnost promoted openness and transparency, allowing for greater freedom of expression. Perestroika aimed to restructure the Soviet economy, introducing limited free-market principles. These reforms, while intended to revitalize the USSR, inadvertently fueled dissent and nationalist sentiments.
7. The Baltic states, emboldened by Gorbachev's reforms, were among the first to demand independence. Their successful secession inspired other republics and demonstrated the weakening grip of the Soviet central government.
8. Yeltsin, elected president of the Russian SFSR, embodied the growing desire for autonomy within the Soviet Union. He challenged Gorbachev's authority and led Russia's secession from the USSR, ultimately becoming the first president of the newly independent Russian Federation.
9. The August 1991 coup was an attempt by communist hardliners to oust Gorbachev and reverse his reforms. The coup failed due to popular resistance, the military's refusal to support it, and Yeltsin's decisive leadership.
10. On December 24, 1991, Gorbachev resigned, and the Soviet Union formally dissolved under the leadership of Boris Yeltsin. This marked the end of the Cold War and the emergence of 15 independent states from the former Soviet republics.
