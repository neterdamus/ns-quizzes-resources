**Answer Key**

1. Khrushchev maneuvered his way to power through political maneuvering and strategic alliances. He outmaneuvered Malenkov, Stalin's heir apparent, by securing control of the party machinery and later removed him from the premiership.
2. Khrushchev's "Reform Communism" aimed to humanize the Soviet system by shifting emphasis from heavy industry to consumer goods production. He also relaxed some social controls, releasing political prisoners and allowing for greater artistic expression.
3. Khrushchev, unlike Stalin, allowed a degree of autonomy to Eastern European communist parties, exemplified by his acceptance of Gomu≈Çka's national communist solution in Poland. However, he drew the line at any threat to the Warsaw Pact, as demonstrated by the Soviet crackdown on the Hungarian Revolution.
4. Khrushchev's "secret speech" denouncing Stalin's crimes marked a watershed moment. It shattered the cult of personality surrounding Stalin and initiated a period of de-Stalinization, leading to political and cultural liberalization and the release of millions of prisoners.
5. The "spirit of Camp David" refers to the perceived improvement in Soviet-American relations during Khrushchev's 1959 visit to the United States. The amicable interactions between Khrushchev and President Eisenhower raised hopes for peaceful coexistence.
6. The Sino-Soviet split stemmed from ideological differences and geopolitical tensions. China criticized Khrushchev's peaceful coexistence policy and his refusal to support Chinese nuclear ambitions. Border disputes further aggravated the relationship.
7. The Cuban Missile Crisis arose from Khrushchev's decision to deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba, a move perceived as a direct threat by the United States. The tense standoff nearly escalated into nuclear war but was averted when Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba.
8. Khrushchev faced resistance from the entrenched Soviet bureaucracy, particularly regarding his decentralization efforts and attempts to reform the agricultural sector. He also grappled with managing the demands for greater freedom from intellectuals and artists while navigating the anxieties of the party apparatus.
9. Khrushchev's ambitious agricultural policies, particularly the Virgin Lands campaign, largely failed to deliver the promised results. These failures, coupled with the need to import grain, undermined his credibility and fueled discontent among the Soviet leadership.
10. Khrushchev's legacy remains complex and multifaceted. He is credited with de-Stalinizing the Soviet Union, initiating reforms, and pursuing peaceful coexistence with the West. However, his erratic leadership style, agricultural failures, and handling of international crises ultimately led to his downfall. Nonetheless, his reforms had a lasting impact on Soviet society and inspired later generations of reformers.
