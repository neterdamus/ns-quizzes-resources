### Short-Answer Key

1. Baltic nationalism, fueled by the memory of their forced annexation in 1940, challenged Soviet leadership by demanding independence, organizing nationalist movements, and taking advantage of Gorbachev's reforms to legitimize their cause. They sought to delegitimize Soviet rule and gain international support for their aspirations.
2. Savisaar's "self-accounting" proposed that republics manage their own economies and resources. This seemingly technical proposal undermined the centralized Soviet system, as it implied republics had control over their economic destiny and challenged the authority of Moscow.
3. The Baltic strategy for independence involved utilizing the Soviet media to broadcast their grievances and gain sympathy, while simultaneously engaging in international diplomacy to garner support for their cause. They cultivated allies and delegitimized the use of force by Moscow through these actions.
4. The "Russian Question" arose as other republics declared sovereignty. It questioned whether the Russian Federation, as the largest and most dominant republic, would also demand independence, leading to the potential disintegration of the Soviet Union.
5. The Soviet bloc's collapse weakened Gorbachev's position by eliminating his leverage over West Germany and exposing the fragility of Soviet power. He was forced to accept German unification within NATO, despite his concerns, in exchange for vague promises about limiting NATO expansion.
6. Yeltsin envisioned a Russia with full legal, economic, and political sovereignty, prioritizing the interests of the Russian Federation over the Union. The Soviet leadership sought to maintain a strong central authority while granting limited autonomy to republics, fearing that granting full sovereignty would lead to the Union's dissolution.
7. The "parade of sovereignties" saw republics, inspired by Russia, declare their own sovereignty and assert control over resources and legislation within their territories. This weakened the central Soviet government and accelerated the fragmentation of the Union. For example, Ukraine's declaration claimed ownership of all resources within its territory and the right to its own state bank and armed forces.
8. The disintegration of the Soviet financial system, with competing monetary policies from Russia and the central government, led to hyperinflation, economic instability, and a loss of confidence in the ruble. This paralyzed economic activity and fueled the push for independence by republics seeking to escape the chaos.
9. The coup highlighted the Soviet economy's dependence on Western aid and its vulnerability to sanctions. The junta's lack of a coherent economic plan and reliance on outdated, centralized control measures demonstrated their inability to manage the crisis and further alienated the republics.
10. Yeltsin, defying Gorbachev and the central Soviet authority, quickly recognized the independence of the Baltic republics, lending legitimacy to their claims and encouraging Western nations to follow suit. This recognition was a pivotal step towards the dissolution of the Soviet Union and solidified Yeltsin's image as a champion of democracy and national self-determination.
