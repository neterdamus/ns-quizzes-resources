## Recognition of the Soviet Union, 1933

**Source:** "Milestones in the History of U.S. Foreign Relations - Office of the Historian"

**Main Themes:**

- The complex and shifting relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union during the interwar period.
- President Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to formally recognize the Soviet Union after nearly 16 years of non-recognition.
- The motivations and key players involved in the recognition process, including the Roosevelt-Litvinov agreements.
- The fragile and ultimately short-lived nature of the initial cooperation, marked by unfulfilled promises and the chilling reality of the Great Purges in the USSR.

**Most Important Ideas/Facts:**

- **Background:** The U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Russia in 1917 following the Bolshevik Revolution. This non-recognition policy continued under successive administrations, despite significant trade relations.
- **Reasons for Recognition:** President Roosevelt sought recognition to leverage Soviet influence against Japanese expansionism in Asia, boost American commerce during the Great Depression, and bring the U.S. in line with other major powers who already recognized the USSR.
- **The Roosevelt-Litvinov Conversations:** These negotiations in November 1933 addressed key obstacles to recognition, including outstanding Soviet debt to the U.S., restrictions on American citizens in the USSR, and Soviet involvement in Communist activities within the U.S.
- **"Gentleman's Agreement":** The resulting agreement saw the Soviets promise future debt negotiations, non-interference in U.S. domestic affairs, and granting religious and legal rights to American citizens in the USSR.
- **Ambassador Bullitt's Disillusionment:** The initial optimism faded quickly as debt agreements faltered, evidence of Soviet interference emerged, and the brutal "Great Purges" commenced in the USSR.
- **Deteriorating Relations:** Despite attempts to improve relations, U.S.-Soviet ties further deteriorated, culminating in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the USSR and Nazi Germany in 1939.

**Key Quotes:**

- "Roosevelt hoped that recognition of the Soviet Union would serve U.S. strategic interests by limiting Japanese expansionism in Asia, and he believed that full diplomatic recognition would serve American commercial interests in the Soviet Union."
- "According to the terms of the Roosevelt-Litvinov agreements, the Soviets pledged to participate in future talks to settle their outstanding financial debt to the United States...Roosevelt also managed to secure guarantees that the Soviet Government would refrain from interfering in American domestic affairs...and would grant certain religious and legal rights for U.S. citizens living in the Soviet Union."
- "The wide scope and public nature of the purges horrified both American diplomatic personnel stationed in the Soviet Union, and the world at large."

**Conclusion:**

The U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union in 1933, while initially promising, ultimately failed to deliver lasting cooperation. A combination of broken promises, ideological differences, and the horrors of Stalinist repression ultimately led to further estrangement between the two nations. The brief period of rapprochement stands as a testament to the complexity of U.S.-Soviet relations throughout the 20th century.
