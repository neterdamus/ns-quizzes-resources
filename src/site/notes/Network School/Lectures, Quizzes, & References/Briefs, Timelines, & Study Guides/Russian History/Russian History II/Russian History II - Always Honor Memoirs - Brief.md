## Pyotr Wrangel's Memoirs "Always With Honor"

This briefing document reviews the main themes and crucial ideas presented in Pyotr Wrangel's memoirs, "Always With Honor," offering insights into his military career, political beliefs, and the chaotic landscape of the Russian Civil War.

**Wrangel, The Soldier:**

Wrangel presents himself as a hardened, battle-tested soldier who thrives in the midst of war. Early on, he establishes this image:

"He was of medium height, fair and puny-looking, with a long reddish moustache, but he possessed an iron constitution and ruthless energy. War was his natural element."

He frequently displays courage and resilience in challenging circumstances. Notably, he faces down a search party during a period of unrest:

"A gang of these ruffians came to search out house without any kind of warrant. I let them get on with it, and went on playing with my six-year-old son, taking not the slightest notice of their movements."

He even finds common ground with enemy soldiers, highlighting his respect for individuals caught in the larger conflict:

"I have never been able to understand those chauvinists who regard as an enemy every man belonging to the nation with which his country is at war. You fight your enemy's Army, but you can respect the individuals who compose it."

**Wrangel's Political and Military Leadership:**

Wrangel emerges as a pragmatist willing to make tough decisions for the greater good of the Russian cause. He expresses deep concern over the politicization of the army during the revolution:

"The Army ought to remain outside politics altogether, and all those who meddled with it were committing a crime against their country."

He demonstrates a firm, decisive leadership style, as seen in his interaction with the mayor disagreeing with his orders:

"I am responsible to the Army and the people, and I follow the dictates of my mind and conscience... Furthermore, I will stop at nothing in the accomplishment of my duty, and will not hesitate to cut down anyone who tries to stop me."

His pragmatic approach extends to the agrarian question, recognizing the need to address the needs of the peasantry:

"The future of Russian agriculture belongs to the small peasant proprietor, big landed estates have had their day. The improvement of the material welfare of the workers and the satisfaction of their industrial needs is one of our principal cares."

He navigates the complexities of alliances while maintaining focus on the ultimate goal:

"I hold the same opinion on the question of 'orientations.' Make agreements with whoever you like, but my watchword is, 'For Russia!'"

**The Challenges of the White Army:**

The memoirs depict the White Army's struggle for survival amidst internal divisions, dwindling resources, and a lack of foreign support. Wrangel expresses frustration with General Denikin's leadership and strategic decisions:

"But it had been clear to me for a long time, and I had not hidden my opinion from the Commander-in-Chief, that we were building on sand, we had bitten off far more than we could chew."

The White Army faces severe resource shortages after its retreat to Crimea:

"Enormous stocks of clothing and munitions had been abandoned in South Russia, and we had nothing with which to re-equip the Army, which lacked clothing and arms."

Despite these challenges, Wrangel remains dedicated to the White cause, appealing to soldiers who joined the Bolsheviks to return to the "true Russian Army":

"I call upon you to join us, so that you may atone for your shame and once more join the ranks of the Russian Army—the true Russian Army."

**The Evacuation from Crimea and Legacy:**

Wrangel ultimately makes the difficult decision to evacuate Crimea, recognizing the dire situation and his responsibility to protect those who followed him:

"I now order the evacuation and embarkation at the Crimean ports of all those who are following the Russian Army on its road to Calvary… I have done everything that human strength can do to fulfil my duty to the Army and the population."

He places the White Army under France's protection:

"...France was the only Power to recognize the South Russian Government and give it moral and material support, therefore I place my Army, my Navy, and all those who have followed me, under the protection of France."

Despite the ultimate defeat, Wrangel portrays the White Army as embodying Russian patriotism, fighting for national resurrection:

"Such, in November 1917, was the birth of the White Army. It was the incarnation of the national sentiment, of the revolt of Russian patriotism… This Army, loyal to all the obligations taken over by previous national governments, still continues the struggle for the honor of its country's name, for the resurrection of Russia as a Nation."

**Concluding Remarks:**

Wrangel's memoirs offer a unique perspective on the tumultuous events of the Russian Civil War. They reveal a dedicated and courageous soldier, a pragmatic leader facing insurmountable challenges, and the enduring spirit of the White Army. His reflections on political and military strategy, as well as his personal experiences, provide valuable insights into this defining chapter in Russian history.
