### Short-Answer Key

1. The options were: (1) withdraw American forces, (2) stay in Berlin until forced out by starvation, or (3) send an armed convoy to open the roads, risking war.
2. The Soviets, having suffered two German invasions, wanted a weakened Germany as a buffer zone. The Western Allies, believing economic hardship fueled Nazi extremism, sought a prosperous, democratic Germany as a bulwark against Soviet expansion.
3. The introduction of the Deutsche Mark in West Berlin by the Western Allies, without Soviet consent, served as the pretext for the blockade.
4. The American generals believed it was logistically impossible to deliver sufficient supplies by air to sustain Berlin's population.
5. Challenges included insufficient aircraft and crews, perilous landing conditions at Tempelhof Airport, outdated C-47 aircraft, and constant harassment by Soviet Yak fighters.
6. Tunner implemented a strict flight schedule, maximized aircraft capacity, enforced maintenance checks, brought in new pilots and C-54s, and utilized German workers and mechanics.
7. Halvorsen's candy drops, dubbed "Operation Little Vittles," humanized the airlift, capturing global attention and boosting morale in Berlin.
8. The Soviets believed the harsh winter weather, particularly fog and ice, would make flying impossible, forcing the Allies to abandon the airlift.
