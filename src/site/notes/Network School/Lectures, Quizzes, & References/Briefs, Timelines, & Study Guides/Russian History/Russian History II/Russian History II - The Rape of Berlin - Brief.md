## The Rape of German Women by the Red Army in 1945

**Source:** Excerpts from "‘The Russian soldiers raped every German female from eight to 80’" by Antony Beevor, The Guardian, May 1, 2002.

**Main Theme:** The article details the mass rapes committed by Red Army soldiers against German women during the final months of World War II, exploring the scale, motivations, and lasting impact of these atrocities.

**Key Facts and Ideas:**

- **Scale and Brutality:** The Red Army's advance into Germany, particularly East Prussia, was marked by widespread rape, with estimates of victims ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions.
- "The Russian soldiers were raping every German female from eight to eighty," recounted Natalya Gesse, a Soviet war correspondent. "It was an army of rapists."
- "Altogether at least two million German women are thought to have been raped, and a substantial minority, if not a majority, appear to have suffered multiple rape."
- **Motivating Factors:Revenge:** The Red Army was fueled by a desire for revenge against the Germans for atrocities committed in the Soviet Union.
- "Calls to avenge the Motherland, violated by the Wehrmacht's invasion, had given the idea that almost any cruelty would be allowed."
- **Sense of Entitlement:** The Red Army viewed German women as spoils of war and a right of conquest.
- "By this stage Soviet soldiers started to treat German women more as sexual spoils of war than as substitutes for the Wehrmacht on which to vent their rage."
- **Sexual Repression in Soviet Society:** Decades of Soviet policy suppressing sexuality created a warped and violent understanding of it among soldiers.
- "The Soviet state's attempts to suppress the libido of its people created what one Russian writer described as a sort of 'barracks eroticism' which was far more primitive and violent than 'the most sordid foreign pornography'."
- **Alcohol:** Widespread alcohol abuse contributed significantly to the violence.
- "Drink of every variety, including dangerous chemicals seized from laboratories and workshops, was a major factor in the violence."
- **Reactions and Consequences:Soviet Response:** While reports reached Stalin and Beria, attempts to curb the violence were largely ineffective.
- "Marshal Rokossovsky issued order No 006 in an attempt to direct 'the feelings of hatred at fighting the enemy on the battlefield.' It appears to have had little effect."
- **German Women's Strategies:** Women resorted to desperate measures to avoid rape, including hiding, offering themselves to one soldier for protection, and eventually, prostitution for survival.
- "Women soon learned to disappear during the 'hunting hours' of the evening. Young daughters were hidden in storage lofts for days on end."
- **Long-Term Trauma:** The physical and psychological scars of the rapes had a profound impact on the victims.
- "In Berlin, many women were simply not prepared for the shock of Russian revenge, however much horror propaganda they had heard from Goebbels."
- **Repression and Denial:** The issue remains largely taboo in Russia, with many veterans refusing to acknowledge the truth.
- "The subject of the Red Army's mass rapes in Germany has been so repressed in Russia that even today veterans refuse to acknowledge what really happened."

**Quotes of Note:**

- "Red Army soldiers don't believe in 'individual liaisons' with German women... Nine, ten, twelve men at a time - they rape them on a collective basis." - Zakhar Agranenko, Red Army officer.
- "Our fellows were so sex-starved," a Soviet major told a British journalist at the time, "that they often raped old women of sixty, seventy or even eighty - much to these grandmothers' surprise, if not downright delight."
- "The 13-year old Dieter Sahl...threw himself with flailing fists at a Russian who was raping his mother in front of him. He did not succeed in anything except getting himself shot."

**Overall, the article presents a harrowing account of the mass rapes committed by the Red Army, highlighting the complexities of wartime violence and the enduring trauma inflicted upon the victims.**
