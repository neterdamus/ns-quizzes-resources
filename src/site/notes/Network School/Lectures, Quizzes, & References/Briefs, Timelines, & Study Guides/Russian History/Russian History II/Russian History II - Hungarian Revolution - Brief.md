**Summary:**

The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was a pivotal moment in the Cold War, highlighting the yearning for freedom and autonomy within Soviet satellite states.

**Key Events:**

- **Catalyst:** Nikita Khrushchev's denouncement of Stalin's reign sparked unrest and debate across the Soviet bloc, emboldening Hungarians to demand change.
- **Uprising:** In October 1956, widespread discontent in Hungary escalated into open rebellion against Soviet control and the imposed communist government.
- **Initial Success:** The rebels achieved early victories, forcing the installation of Imre Nagy as premier. Nagy responded by promising democratic reforms, including a multiparty system.
- **Declaration of Neutrality:** On November 1st, 1956, Nagy made a bold move, declaring Hungary's neutrality and appealing to the United Nations for protection against Soviet intervention.
- **Soviet Invasion:** The West's reluctance to intervene militarily emboldened the Soviet Union, which launched a full-scale invasion on November 4th, 1956, crushing the revolution.
- **Aftermath:** Imre Nagy was arrested, later executed for treason in 1958. While the revolution failed to liberate Hungary, it had lasting consequences. The brutality of the Soviet response shocked the world and forced a reevaluation of Soviet power. Within Hungary, the revolution led to a gradual easing of hardline Stalinist policies, allowing for some internal autonomy.

**Key Figures:**

- **Imre Nagy:** Reformist Hungarian leader who became premier during the revolution, ultimately executed for his role in the uprising.
- **Nikita Khrushchev:** Soviet leader whose de-Stalinization policies inadvertently spurred the Hungarian uprising.
- **János Kádár:** Installed by the Soviet Union as the leader of Hungary after the revolution was crushed.

**Themes:**

- **Desire for freedom and self-determination:** The revolution highlighted the deep-seated yearning for liberty and independence from Soviet domination within the Eastern bloc.
- **Brutal suppression of dissent:** The Soviet Union's forceful response demonstrated its willingness to use military might to maintain control over its satellite states.
- **Limitations of Western support:** The lack of concrete military intervention from Western powers revealed the complexities and limitations of Cold War alliances.
- **Lasting Impact:** While unsuccessful in the short term, the Hungarian Revolution served as a powerful symbol of resistance against Soviet oppression and contributed to the eventual erosion of Soviet power.

**Key Quote:**

"On November 4 the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to stop the revolution, and Nagy was executed for treason in 1958. Nevertheless, Stalinist-type domination and exploitation did not return, and Hungary thereafter experienced a slow evolution toward some internal autonomy." - Source Text
