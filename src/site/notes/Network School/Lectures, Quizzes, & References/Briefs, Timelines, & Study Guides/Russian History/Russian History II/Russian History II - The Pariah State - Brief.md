## Felix Dzerzhinsky and the Red Terror

**Source:** "How KGB founder Iron Felix justified terror and mass executions - Big Think"

**Main Theme:** The article examines the life and legacy of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka, the Soviet Union's first secret police force, and a key figure in the "Red Terror."

**Key Points:**

- **The Cheka and the Red Terror:** Dzerzhinsky, nicknamed "Iron Felix," led the Cheka during a period of mass executions known as the Red Terror (1918). This campaign, spurred by a failed assassination attempt on Lenin, targeted perceived enemies of the state, including those deemed "class enemies."
- **Justifications for Terror:** Dzerzhinsky believed terror was necessary to solidify the revolution. He stated, "_We stand for organized terror – this should be frankly admitted. Terror is an absolute necessity during times of revolution._" He saw the Cheka as a tool to eliminate those opposed to the "new order of life."
- **Methods and Scale of Violence:** The Cheka operated with swift brutality, often moving from arrest to execution within a day. Killings occurred in prisons and public spaces without oversight. Estimates suggest at least 10,000-15,000 people were killed, with some historians arguing the number could be as high as one million.
- **Legacy of Dzerzhinsky and the Cheka:** The Cheka evolved into the KGB, and Dzerzhinsky's legacy remains controversial. Some view him as a brutal dictator, while others, including some within the current Russian government, see him as a hero who protected the revolution. This conflicting perspective is highlighted by the toppling and subsequent restoration of some of his monuments.
