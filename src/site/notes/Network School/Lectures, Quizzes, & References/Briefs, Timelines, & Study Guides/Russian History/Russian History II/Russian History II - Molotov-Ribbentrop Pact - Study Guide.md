**Answer Key:**

1. **The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was officially a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. However, the secret protocols revealed the agreement to partition Poland and divide Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, directly contradicting the public non-aggression stance.**

4. **The Confidential Protocol allowed Germany to resettle ethnic Germans from Soviet-controlled areas to German territory, and vice versa for Ukrainians and Belorussians in German-controlled zones. This signifies population transfer based on ethnicity.**
5. **Both Germany and the Soviet Union sought to suppress any potential Polish resistance or nationalistic movements within their respective territories following the partition of Poland.**
6. **The September 28th protocol states that existing German-Lithuanian economic agreements should remain intact despite Lithuania's inclusion in the Soviet sphere, indicating a Soviet intention to benefit from these agreements.**
7. **While not detailed in the excerpt, the exchange of letters likely concerned economic cooperation and trade agreements, reflecting the opportunistic economic aspects of the pact alongside political arrangements.**

9. **The January 10th protocol, involving financial compensation for territory, reveals that even while cooperating, Germany and the Soviet Union continued to negotiate and adjust their territorial gains and interests.**
