**Answer Key**

1. Wrangel is described as "of medium height, fair and puny-looking" but possessing "an iron constitution and ruthless energy." He is a natural soldier who thrives in war.
2. Wrangel's superior is driven to despair by the political turmoil engulfing Russia, particularly the interference of "scoundrels" in the army. He sends Wrangel to Petersburg to plead with Goutchkov, the Minister, about the dangers these actions pose.
3. Wrangel remains calm and ignores the "ruffians" searching his house, continuing to play with his son. This demonstrates his composure under pressure and his refusal to be provoked.
4. Wrangel's wife chooses to stay imprisoned with him, stating her desire to remain by his side. Vakula, the Bolshevik, is surprised and impressed by her unwavering loyalty.
5. Wrangel believes chauvinists, who automatically view anyone from an enemy nation as an enemy, are wrong. His friendship and shared hunts with the German Lieutenant Ohnemuller, despite being on opposite sides of the war, illustrate his point that individuals can be respected even amidst conflict between nations.
6. Wrangel criticizes Denikin's focus on a rapid advance towards Moscow, arguing that they have overextended their forces and neglected to secure their flanks and establish strong bases in their rear.
7. The Kuban Rada desires an autonomous Cossack army, while Wrangel prioritizes unified command under himself. He ultimately threatens to dissolve the Rada if they continue to obstruct his authority, demonstrating his firm leadership and commitment to a centralized military structure.
8. Despite the increasing calls for him to assume command, Wrangel maintains his loyalty to Denikin and focuses on fulfilling his assigned duties. He shows restraint and avoids directly challenging the existing leadership.
9. Wrangel believes fortifying Novorossiisk would signal weakness and create panic among the troops and the populace. Denikin's refusal to fortify the city indicates a misplaced confidence in their ability to hold territory and a reluctance to acknowledge the potential for defeat.
10. Wrangel's proclamation emphasizes unity, forgiveness, and the shared goal of liberating Russia from Bolshevik rule. He promises to pardon those who join his forces and appeals to their patriotism, aiming to sway enemy soldiers and bolster his ranks.
