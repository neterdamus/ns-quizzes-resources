## Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Secret Supplementary Protocols

**Date:** September 1939

**Subject:** Analysis of the Secret Supplementary Protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact (1939-1941)

**Key Findings:**

This document comprises a collection of seven secret protocols and related correspondence between the USSR, represented by Foreign Minister Molotov, and Nazi Germany, represented by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Ambassador Schulenburg. These protocols outline the clandestine agreements made alongside the publicly announced non-aggression pact signed on August 23, 1939.

**Thematic Analysis:**

**1. Division of Eastern Europe into Spheres of Influence:**

The core theme across these protocols is the division of Eastern Europe into spheres of influence between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The initial agreement on August 23, 1939, stipulated the following:

- **Baltic States:** The northern border of Lithuania would demarcate the German and Soviet spheres. Both sides acknowledged Lithuanian interests in the Vilnius region. ("In the event of territorial-political reorganization of the districts making up the Baltic states...the northern border of Lithuania is simultaneously the border of the spheres of interest of Germany and the USSR." - Secret Supplementary Protocol, August 23, 1939)
- **Poland:** The spheres would be divided approximately along the Pisa, Narew, Vistula, and San rivers. The future of an independent Poland was deliberately left ambiguous, subject to "future political development." ("In the event of territorial-political reorganization of the districts making up the Polish Republic, the border of the spheres of interest of Germany and the USSR will run approximately along the Pisa, Narew, Vistula, and San rivers." - Secret Supplementary Protocol, August 23, 1939)
- **Southeastern Europe:** The Soviet Union expressed interest in Bessarabia, while Germany declared its "complete political disinterest" in this region.

**2. Modifications and Adjustments:**

Subsequent protocols modified these initial agreements. Notably:

- **Clarification on Polish Border:** An August 28, 1939 clarification removed ambiguity about the Polish border, firmly establishing the rivers as the dividing line.
- **Lithuania's Absorption into Soviet Sphere:** A September 28, 1939 protocol shifted Lithuania entirely into the Soviet sphere, in exchange for adjustments favoring Germany in the Lublin and Warsaw regions of Poland. ("Point 1 of the secret supplementary protocol signed on August 23, 1939, is changed so that the territory of the Lithuanian state is included in the sphere of interest of the USSR..." - Secret Supplementary Protocol, September 28, 1939)
- **Compensation for Lithuania:** In a January 10, 1941 protocol, Germany renounced its claims to the designated Lithuanian territory in exchange for 7,500,000 gold dollars from the Soviet Union.

**3. Population Transfer and Political Control:**

These agreements also facilitated the transfer of populations and aimed to suppress Polish political activity:

- **Resettlement of Ethnic Groups:** A confidential protocol permitted the relocation of German and Ukrainian/Belarusian populations within their respective spheres of influence.
- **Suppression of Polish Agitation:** Both parties committed to suppressing Polish agitation within their respective territories.

**4. Economic Cooperation:**

The documents also include exchanges related to economic cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union.

**Significance:**

These secret protocols reveal the cynical realpolitik underlying the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. They demonstrate a blatant disregard for the sovereignty of nations and the self-determination of the people inhabiting the affected regions. They facilitated the invasion and partition of Poland, the annexation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union, and laid the groundwork for future conflict and suffering in Eastern Europe. The secrecy surrounding these agreements also highlights the deliberate deception employed by both regimes.

**Further Research:**

Further investigation is recommended to analyze the impact of these protocols on the outbreak of World War II, the subsequent fate of the affected populations, and the long-term consequences for international relations.
