## Timeline of Events

**1895-1912:** Felix Dzerzhinsky is repeatedly arrested and exiled to Siberia for his activities with Polish and Lithuanian Social Democrats. He also manages to escape from exile several times.

**1912-1917:** Dzerzhinsky is imprisoned.

**February 1917:** Dzerzhinsky is freed during the February Revolution.

**October 1917:** The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, seize power in Russia during the October Revolution.

**August 1918:** An assassination attempt is made on Lenin's life.

**September-October 1918:** The “Red Terror” is unleashed, a period of mass executions carried out by the Cheka and the Red Army, targeting those deemed enemies of the state. It is estimated that between 10,000 to 15,000 people were killed during this period, though the actual number could be much higher.

**1918:** Dzerzhinsky makes chilling statements about the necessity of terror during revolution and frankly admits the use of organized terror. He also defines the Red Terror as the terrorization, arrest, and extermination of enemies of the revolution based on their class or pre-revolutionary roles.

**1922-1923:** The Cheka is transformed into the GPU (State Political Directorate).

**Post-Soviet Era:** Dzerzhinsky's legacy is reevaluated, with monuments being toppled and the truth about his actions being explored. However, the Kremlin and some current Russian leaders have attempted to rehabilitate aspects of Soviet history, including celebrating the founding of the Cheka and restoring some monuments.

## Cast of Characters

He was the founder and head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police force responsible for carrying out the Red Terror. He was known for his ruthlessness and unwavering commitment to communism. He also oversaw economic reforms, popularized sports, and created a system of orphanages.

**Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924):** Leader of the Bolsheviks and the first head of the Soviet state. He fully supported Dzerzhinsky and the Cheka's use of terror to eliminate perceived enemies of the revolution.

**Alexander Zdanovich:** A historian and retired FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation) officer who believes Dzerzhinsky's legacy should not be solely focused on his brutality but also on his role in founding a powerful security service.

**Ariadna Kozina:** An activist who opposes attempts to rehabilitate figures like Dzerzhinsky, viewing them as glorifying negative aspects of the Soviet past.

**George Leggett:** Author of the book "The Cheka: Lenin’s Political Police," which provides insight into Dzerzhinsky's definition and justification for the Red Terror.

**Vladimir Putin:** Current President of Russia, who served as a KGB officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of Colonel. His background in the KGB influences his leadership style and approach to governance.
