### Short Answer Key

1. The accused were primarily charged with treason, sabotage, espionage, and plotting to overthrow the Soviet government. They were accused of collaborating with Leon Trotsky and foreign powers to undermine Stalin's leadership.

3. Andrey Vyshinsky was the chief prosecutor in the show trials, known for his aggressive and theatrical style. He played a key role in presenting the fabricated evidence and securing guilty verdicts.

6. The political climate was marked by growing paranoia, suspicion, and fear. Stalin was consolidating his power, and any perceived dissent or opposition was brutally suppressed.
