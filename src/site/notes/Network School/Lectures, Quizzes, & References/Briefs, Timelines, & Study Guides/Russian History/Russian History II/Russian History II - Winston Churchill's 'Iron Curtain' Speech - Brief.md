## Winston Churchill's "Iron Curtain" Speech

**Source:** "Winston Churchill’s Iron Curtain Speech—March 5, 1946" from The National WWII Museum

**Main Themes:**

- **The Dawn of the Cold War:** Churchill's speech is widely considered to mark the beginning of the Cold War, highlighting the growing divide between the Soviet Union and the West.
- **The Iron Curtain Descends:** The speech popularized the term "Iron Curtain" to describe the ideological and physical barrier separating Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe from the West.
- **The Importance of the Anglo-American Alliance:** Churchill stressed the vital importance of a strong partnership between the United States and Great Britain as a bulwark against Soviet expansionism.

**Key Ideas & Facts:**

- **Setting the Stage:** The speech was delivered on March 5, 1946, at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. Despite taking place mere months after the Allied victory in WWII, a sense of unease about Soviet intentions pervaded the early postwar world.
- **Soviet Actions:** Churchill pointed to Soviet actions in Eastern Europe, where Moscow was installing communist regimes, as evidence of their expansionist ambitions. He highlighted Stalin's February 1946 speech declaring the inevitability of war between communist and capitalist nations as a clear warning sign.
- **The Iron Curtain:** Churchill declared, _"From Stettin in the Baltic, to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent."_ This metaphorical barrier represented not only geographical division but also the suppression of freedom and democracy in Eastern Europe under Soviet domination.
- **The Special Relationship:** Emphasizing the shared values and interests of the US and Great Britain, Churchill coined the term "special relationship" to advocate for a close alliance to counter Soviet influence.
- **Call for Strength and Unity:** Churchill urged the West to maintain military strength and unity within organizations like the United Nations to deter Soviet aggression and safeguard peace. He drew a parallel with the failure of the League of Nations, advocating for a more robust international body.

**Lasting Impact:**

Churchill's "Iron Curtain" speech proved prophetic. It framed the geopolitical landscape for the next half-century, shaping Western foreign policy and solidifying the narrative of the Cold War. The speech also cemented the "special relationship" between the US and UK, a partnership that endures to this day.
