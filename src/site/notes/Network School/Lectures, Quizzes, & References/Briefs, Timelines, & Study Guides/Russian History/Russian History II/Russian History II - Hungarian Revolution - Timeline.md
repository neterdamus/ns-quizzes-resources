## Timeline of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956

**1956:**

- **February:** Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union, delivers a speech denouncing the policies and crimes of Joseph Stalin. This speech, known as the "Secret Speech," sparks debate and criticism across the Soviet bloc, including Hungary.
- **October:**Growing unrest and discontent in Hungary, fueled by Khrushchev's speech and local grievances, boils over into open revolt. Protests erupt across the country, demanding democratic reforms and an end to Soviet control.
- Rebels gain control of Budapest and other key cities during the initial phase of the revolution.
- Imre Nagy, a reform-minded communist, is appointed Prime Minister. He agrees to a multi-party system and other concessions.
- **November 1st:** Nagy announces Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and declares the country's neutrality. He appeals to the United Nations for support and protection against Soviet intervention.
- **November 4th:** Soviet forces invade Hungary, crushing the revolution and installing a pro-Soviet government led by János Kádár.
- **1958:** Imre Nagy is executed for treason.

**Post-Revolution:**

- Despite the brutal suppression of the revolution, Hungary experiences gradual liberalization over the following decades. The harsh Stalinist-style rule is not fully reinstated, and the country slowly moves towards internal autonomy within the Soviet bloc.
