### Answer Key

1. The Cheka was the first secret police force established by the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Russian Revolution. Its primary function was to suppress counter-revolutionaries and consolidate Bolshevik control through surveillance, arrests, and executions.
2. The "Red Terror" was a period of state-sanctioned violence that began in late 1918, spurred by a failed assassination attempt on Lenin and the ongoing Russian Civil War. The Bolsheviks, facing internal and external threats, sought to eliminate any opposition and instill fear to maintain their grip on power.
3. Dzerzhinsky believed that terror was an essential tool for eliminating enemies of the revolution and establishing a new social order. He argued that swift and brutal action was necessary to prevent further counter-revolutionary activities and protect the nascent Soviet state.
4. In addition to leading the Cheka, Dzerzhinsky held various positions in the Soviet government, including overseeing economic reforms, improving infrastructure, and addressing social issues like homelessness. He even served as the chairman of the Society of Friends of Soviet Cinema.
5. Dzerzhinsky advocated for bypassing traditional legal processes in dealing with counter-revolutionaries. He favored swift judgment and execution, often based on class affiliation or perceived opposition to the regime, rather than due process and fair trials.
6. The Red Terror played a crucial role in solidifying Bolshevik power. It effectively silenced dissent, instilled fear in the population, and eliminated potential threats to the regime, paving the way for the establishment of a one-party state.
7. Dzerzhinsky's legacy in post-Soviet Russia is complex and contested. Some view him as a brutal dictator responsible for mass killings, while others see him as a dedicated revolutionary who defended the Soviet state. His statues have been both toppled and re-erected, reflecting the ongoing debate about his role in Russian history.
8. The Cheka's methods and ideology laid the foundation for a repressive security apparatus that persisted throughout the Soviet era. This legacy of suspicion, surveillance, and violence had a lasting impact on Soviet society, suppressing dissent and limiting individual freedoms.
9. Supporters of Dzerzhinsky often argue that his actions were justified by the extraordinary circumstances of the Russian Revolution and Civil War. They believe he was a decisive leader who made difficult choices to ensure the survival of the Soviet state and protect it from internal and external enemies.
10. Dzerzhinsky's leadership of the Cheka established a precedent for a powerful and ruthless security apparatus in the Soviet Union. This organization, evolving through various names and forms, eventually became the KGB, showcasing the lasting impact of Dzerzhinsky's approach to state security.
