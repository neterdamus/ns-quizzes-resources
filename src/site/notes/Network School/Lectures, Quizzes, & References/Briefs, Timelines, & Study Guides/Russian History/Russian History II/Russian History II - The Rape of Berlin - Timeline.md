## Timeline of Events:

**1920s:** Lively debate about sexual freedom occurs within Communist party circles.

**1930s:** Stalin enforces a depiction of Soviet society as virtually asexual, suppressing human urges and emotions in favor of devotion to the party and Stalin. Freud's work is banned, divorce and adultery are disapproved of, and criminal sanctions against homosexuality are reintroduced. Sex education is suppressed.

**Pre-1945:** Nazi Germany invades the Soviet Union, committing atrocities against Soviet civilians. Nazi propaganda demonizes Russians.

**January 1945:** The Red Army advances into East Prussia. Mass rapes of German women, aged eight to eighty, occur. Soviet soldiers, fueled by alcohol and a desire for revenge, commit widespread sexual violence, including gang rapes and mutilation. Some Soviet women soldiers and medical staff witness the rapes and either do not disapprove or find them amusing.

**March 1945:** Reports of the rapes reach Moscow. Marshal Rokossovsky issues order No 006 to curb the violence, but it has little effect. Isolated attempts to punish perpetrators are made, but the lack of discipline makes it difficult to restore order. The rapes extend beyond German women, with Polish women and even Soviet women and girls who had been forced into slave labor in Germany also becoming victims.

**March 29, 1945:** A report from the 1st Ukrainian Front details the rape of Soviet women by Red Army soldiers, undermining the justification of the rapes as revenge against German atrocities.

**April/May 1945:** The Red Army reaches Berlin. Mass rapes continue, with estimates ranging from 95,000 to 130,000 victims in the city alone. However, a pattern of selection emerges, with soldiers choosing their victims rather than engaging in indiscriminate violence. Some women are forced to "concede" to one soldier for protection from others.

**Post-surrender:** The need to survive starvation leads some women to prostitution in exchange for food or cigarettes. Some Red Army officers enter into relationships with German women, leading to desertions when the officers are ordered back to the Soviet Union.

**Post-war:** The subject of the mass rapes is repressed in both Soviet and Russian society. Veterans deny or downplay the events, while those who speak openly are unrepentant.

**2002:** Antony Beevor publishes "Berlin: The Downfall 1945," bringing the issue of the mass rapes to wider public attention.
