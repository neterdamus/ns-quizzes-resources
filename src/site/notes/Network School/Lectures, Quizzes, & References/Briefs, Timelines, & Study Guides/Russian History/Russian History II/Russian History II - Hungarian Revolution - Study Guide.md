**Answer Key**

1. Nikita Khrushchev's "Secret Speech" in 1956, denouncing Stalin's cult of personality and policies, sparked the unrest. This speech encouraged a wave of liberalization and criticism within the Soviet bloc, leading to calls for reform in Hungary.
2. Imre Nagy was a Hungarian communist politician who became the Premier during the revolution. He responded to the uprising by enacting reforms, including establishing a multi-party system and declaring Hungary's neutrality, withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact.
3. The Hungarian Revolution aimed to overthrow the Soviet-imposed communist government and establish a more democratic and independent Hungary. It sought to break free from Soviet control and determine its own political and economic future.
4. The Soviet Union responded to Nagy's declaration of neutrality with military force. They invaded Hungary on November 4, 1956, crushing the revolution and reinstating a pro-Soviet government.
5. Western powers were hesitant to intervene in the Hungarian Revolution due to fears of escalating the Cold War into a direct conflict with the Soviet Union. They were also preoccupied with the Suez Crisis, which unfolded simultaneously.
6. Imre Nagy was arrested after the Soviet invasion, imprisoned, and eventually executed for treason in 1958. He became a martyr for the cause of Hungarian freedom and resistance against Soviet domination.
7. Although the revolution was unsuccessful in the short term, it had a lasting impact on Hungary. It forced the Soviet Union to make some concessions, leading to a period of relative liberalization and economic improvement in Hungary, known as "Goulash Communism."
8. The Hungarian Revolution was unique in its level of violence and the initial success of the revolutionaries in ousting the Soviet-backed regime. It also involved a clear declaration of neutrality and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, distinguishing it from other uprisings.
9. The Hungarian Revolution failed due to several factors, including the overwhelming military power of the Soviet Union, the lack of Western intervention, and internal divisions within the revolutionary forces.
10. The Hungarian Revolution is significant in the Cold War as a symbol of resistance against Soviet oppression and the desire for freedom and self-determination in Eastern Europe. It exposed the brutality of Soviet control and highlighted the limitations of Western support for anti-communist uprisings.
