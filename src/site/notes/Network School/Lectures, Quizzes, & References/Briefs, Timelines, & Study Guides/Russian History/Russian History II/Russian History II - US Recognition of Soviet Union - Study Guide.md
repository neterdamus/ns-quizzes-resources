**Answer Key**

1. The U.S. refused recognition due to the Soviet Union's refusal to honor Tsarist debts, disregard for pre-existing treaties, seizure of American property, and separate peace with Germany in WWI.
2. Roosevelt aimed to limit Japanese expansionism, boost American commercial interests during the Great Depression, and align the U.S. with other major powers recognizing the Soviet Union.
3. These conversations led to a "gentleman's agreement" addressing debt settlement, Soviet non-interference in U.S. affairs, and rights for American citizens in the USSR, paving the way for formal recognition.
4. Relations deteriorated due to stalled debt negotiations, evidence of Soviet interference in U.S. affairs, and the launch of the "Great Purges," which horrified the international community.
5. The "Great Purges" aimed to eliminate perceived threats to Stalin's power, resulting in the deaths or imprisonment of millions and projecting an image of brutality and repression.
6. Bullitt, the first U.S. ambassador, initially fostered cooperation but became disillusioned. Davies, his successor, re-established amicable relations but downplayed the severity of the purges.
7. The pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany deepened distrust between the U.S. and USSR, as it appeared to align the Soviets with a regime seen as hostile to American interests.
8. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 forced the U.S. and USSR to find common ground against a shared enemy.
9. Recognition achieved some initial goals, like opening trade, but ultimately failed to foster long-term stability or prevent Soviet expansionism.
10. Relations between 1917 and 1939 were marked by fluctuating periods of cautious cooperation and deep mistrust, ultimately culminating in an uneasy alliance driven by circumstance.
